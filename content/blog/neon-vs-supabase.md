This post is maintained by Bytebase, an open-source database DevSecOps tool that can manage both Neon and Supabase (it's PG after all). We update the post every year.

Besides the typical Postgres service providers like AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, DigitalOcean Managed Databases, [Neon](https://neon.tech/) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) are the two modern Postgres service providers.

On the surface, Neon and Supabase are different products. Neon is a database service. While Supabase is a BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service) and Postgres is one of its included service.

They are comparable because they both offer a **developer-friendly**, **scalable** Postgres service.

And their websites certainly don't help the choice easier.

At Bytebase, we are Postgres fans. Our founders build [Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql) and Bytebase
also chooses Postgres to store its own metadata. Below we compare Neon and Supabase from
the following dimensions:

- [Architecture](#architecture)
- [Compatibility](#compatibility)
- [Branching](#branching)
- [Operability](#operability)
- [Integration](#integration)
- [Compliance](#compliance)
- [Open Source](#open-source)
- [Pricing](#pricing)

## Architecture

Neon is a shared-storage architecture. It separates the compute and storage. The compute part is
just normal Postgres server, the storage part is a custom-built multi-tenant storage system shared
by all Postgres compute nodes.

Supabase is a battery-included Postgres platform. It uses vanilla Postgres as the core and augments the
database with various middlewares.

## Compatibility

Neon is mostly compatible with vanilla Postgres whereas Supabase is a dedicated vanilla Postgres instance. They both bear the limitations of
a hosted database service (e.g. no superuser).

- [Supabase compatibility](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/roles-superuser)

## Branching

Both Neon and Supabase are targeting developers, and they both offer a branching feature.

Neon purpose-built paging layer has copy-on-write (CoW), which enables database cloning instantaneous and cost-effective.

Supabase branching integrates with Git repository. It provisions a new empty database, runs the migration script and initializes the seed data.

Overall, Neon's instant branch cloning is closer to the Git semantics.

## Integration

Neon integrates with application platforms such as Vercel to provide a high-fidelity preview environment.

Supabase is an application platform by itself. Thus it boasts a wide variety of integrations.

Also there are quite a few SaaS boilerplates based on Supabase.

## Compliance

Both Neon and Supabase achieves SOC2 Type 2. Supabase is additionally HIPAA compliant, a requirement for storing health data such as medical records:

- [Supabase security](https://supabase.com/security)

## Open Source

Neon [open sources](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon) its entire database codebase under Apache-2.0 license.

Supabase also [open sources](https://github.com/supabase/supabase) its entire platform under Apache-2.0 license.

Supabase is one of the most popular repositories on GitHub, while Neon's star growth is also impressive.

## Pricing

Both Neon and Supabase offer a free tier and tiered pricing models that scale with usage. However, their pricing structures differ significantly in how they charge for resources.

Neon uses a compute-hours model with the ability to scale to zero when not in use. Their pricing is based on:

1. **Base subscription fee** (Free, Launch at $19/month, Scale at $69/month, Business at $700/month)
1. **Compute hours consumed** (each plan includes a set amount)
1. **Storage used** (regular and archive storage)

The Free plan includes 191.9 compute hours per month (enough to run a 0.25 CU compute 24/7) and 0.5 GB of storage. Paid plans include more compute hours and storage, with the option to purchase additional resources as needed.

Supabase uses a dedicated compute instance model with hourly billing. Their pricing is based on:

1. **Base subscription fee** (Free, Pro at $25/month, Team at $599/month, Enterprise with custom pricing)
1. **Compute instance size** (from Nano to 16XL)
1. **Usage-based components** (active users, storage, bandwidth, etc.)

The Free plan includes a Nano compute instance with shared CPU and up to 0.5 GB of memory, 500 MB of database storage, and 50,000 monthly active users. Paid plans include $10/month in compute credits and additional resources.

## Neon or Supabase

If you want a Postgres database without whistles and bells, Neon is almost the perfect database a developer would desire. It has serverless, branching, auto-scaling.

If you're looking for a dedicated Postgres instance or are looking to build a full-stack application, Supabase has everything
you need. It has database, auth, APIs, and more, with continuous improvements to its dashboard and developer experience.
