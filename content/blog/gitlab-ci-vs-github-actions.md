## Detailed Comparison

### Configuration and Setup

**GitLab CI** uses a single `.gitlab-ci.yml` file placed at the root of your repository. This file defines your entire CI/CD pipeline, including stages, jobs, and scripts to be executed.

**GitHub Actions** uses YAML files stored in the `.github/workflows` directory. You can have multiple workflow files, each defining a separate automated process triggered by different events.

Both platforms use YAML for configuration, but GitLab CI centralizes all pipeline definitions in a single file, while GitHub Actions allows for multiple workflow files organized by purpose.

### Integration with Platform

**GitLab CI** is deeply integrated with the **GitLab platform,** forming part of GitLab's complete DevOps solution. This tight integration means seamless connections between **code, issues, merge requests, and CI/CD pipelines** all within the same platform.

**GitHub Actions** is natively integrated with **GitHub repositories** and the broader GitHub ecosystem. It works seamlessly with GitHub features like **pull requests, issues, and project boards**, providing a cohesive development experience for GitHub users.

The key difference is that GitLab offers an all-in-one platform approach, while GitHub Actions focuses on tight integration with GitHub's repository-centric workflow.

### Execution Environment

Both platforms offer similar options for running your CI/CD jobs:

**GitLab CI** provides:

- Self-hosted runners or GitLab.com-hosted runners
- Support for Linux, Windows, and macOS

**GitHub Actions** provides:

- GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runners
- Support for Linux, Windows, and macOS
- Free unlimited minutes for public repositories

### Pricing Model

| Plan                  | GitLab CI                       | GitHub Actions                       |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------ | :----------------------------------- |
| Free                  | $0/user/month, 400 minutes      | $0/user/month, 2,000 minutes         |
| Team / Premium        | $29/user/month (10,000 minutes) | $4/user/month (3,000 minutes)        |
| Enterprise / Ultimate | Contact sales (50,000 minutes)  | From $21/user/month (50,000 minutes) |

**GitHub Actions** is **more affordable** at the **Team** level compared to GitLab's **Premium** pricing, making it attractive for **smaller teams**.

### Ecosystem and Reusability

**GitLab CI** offers:

- CI/CD catalog with **components and templates**
- Reusable pipeline configurations
- Ability to **share components** across projects

**GitHub Actions** offers:

- **Extensive marketplace** with thousands of pre-built actions
- **Reusable workflows** across repositories
- **Strong community contributions**

GitHub Actions has a larger marketplace of pre-built components, making it easier to find ready-made solutions for common tasks. GitLab CI's approach focuses more on creating and sharing your own reusable components.

### Advanced Features

**GitLab CI** stands out with:

- **Merge trains:** Keep the main branch stable by merging changes in a controlled order.
- **Parent-child pipelines:** Break complex workflows into smaller, manageable parts.
- **Security and compliance:** Built-in tools for security scanning and regulatory compliance.
- **Progressive delivery:** Support for canary deployments to safely deploy updates.

**GitHub Actions** shines with:

- **Matrix builds:** Test across different environments and configurations easily.
- **Workflow reuse:** Share and reuse workflows across multiple repositories.
- **Environment protection:** Set rules to control deployments to sensitive environments.
- **Scheduled and manual workflows:** Run workflows on a schedule or trigger them manually when needed.

### Ease of Use

**GitLab CI** has a steeper learning curve but offers more power for complex pipelines. Its unified configuration approach makes it more structured but potentially more complex for beginners.

**GitHub Actions** is generally simpler to get started with, especially for those already familiar with GitHub. Its event-driven model and marketplace make it accessible for newcomers.

## Conclusion

**GitLab CI** is a strong choice for teams needing **complex, enterprise-grade CI/CD pipelines**, offering advanced features like security scanning, compliance tools, and deep integration with the entire GitLab DevOps platform. In contrast, **GitHub Actions** shines for its **simplicity, fast setup, and extensive marketplace of reusable actions**, making it an excellent option for teams already using GitHub or those looking for a flexible, event-driven CI/CD solution.
