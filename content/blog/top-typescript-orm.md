## Introduction

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries have become essential tools in modern TypeScript development, **bridging the gap between application code and database systems**. A good ORM not only simplifies database interactions but also enhances type safety, improves developer productivity, and helps maintain clean, maintainable code.

In 2025, TypeScript developers have several mature ORM options to choose from, this article provides a comprehensive comparison of five leading TypeScript ORMs: **Drizzle ORM**, **Prisma ORM**, **TypeORM**, **Sequelize**, and **MikroORM**.

## Drizzle ORM

[Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) is a lightweight, TypeScript-first ORM with a SQL-centric approach and zero dependencies ‚Äî ideal for serverless environments. Described as **"a headless TypeScript ORM with a head,"** it emphasizes familiarity: **"If you know SQL, you know Drizzle."**

**Highlights:**

- Dual query APIs (SQL-like and relational)
- Zero dependencies (\~7.4kb min+gzip)
- Fully built in TypeScript
- Schema defined in TypeScript, closely mirroring SQL
- Dialect-optimized and supports automatic migrations via Drizzle Kit

**Code Example:**

```typescript
import { pgTable, serial, varchar } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';

export const users = pgTable('users', {
  id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
  name: varchar('name', { length: 50 }),
  email: varchar('email', { length: 100 }),
});
```

## Prisma ORM

[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) is a modern ORM for **Node.js and TypeScript** that prioritizes developer experience and type safety through a declarative, schema-first approach and powerful tooling.

![prisma](/content/blog/top-typescript-orm/prisma.webp)

**Highlights:**

- Define models in **Prisma Schema Language (PSL)**
- Auto-generated, type-safe client with strong IDE support
- Declarative migrations via Prisma Migrate
- Visual database management with Prisma Studio
- Introspect existing databases into schema
- Raw SQL support when needed
- Scaling tools like Prisma Accelerate and Pulse

**Code Example:**

```prisma
// schema.prisma
model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String
  email String @unique
}

```

```typescript
// Usage
const user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: { name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com' },
});
```

## TypeORM

[TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) is a flexible and mature ORM for TypeScript and JavaScript that supports both **Active Record** and **Data Mapper** patterns, making it adaptable to different project architectures.

![typeorm](/content/blog/top-typescript-orm/typeorm.webp)

**Highlights:**

- Define entities using **TypeScript classes and decorators**
- Supports complex relationships and lazy/eager loading
- Powerful SQL-like query builder
- Migration tools for schema evolution
- Works with multiple databases and across platforms
- Dual architectural pattern support (Active Record & Data Mapper)
- Repository abstraction for structured data access

**Code Example:**

```typescript
import { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column } from 'typeorm';

@Entity()
export class User {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  name: string;

  @Column({ unique: true })
  email: string;
}
```

## Sequelize ORM

[Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) is a mature, feature-rich ORM for Node.js with solid support for TypeScript. It balances abstraction and control with a comprehensive, Promise-based API.

![sequelize](/content/blog/top-typescript-orm/sequelize.webp)

**Highlights:**

- Async/await-friendly with Promise-based API
- Define models with validations, associations, and data types
- Supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and SQL Server
- Robust transaction and connection pooling support
- Comprehensive relationship handling (1:1, 1\:N, N\:M)
- Lifecycle hooks and raw SQL support

**Code Example:**

```typescript
import { Sequelize, DataTypes } from 'sequelize';

const sequelize = new Sequelize('sqlite::memory:');

const User = sequelize.define('User', {
  id: { type: DataTypes.INTEGER, autoIncrement: true, primaryKey: true },
  name: DataTypes.STRING,
  email: { type: DataTypes.STRING, unique: true },
});
```

## MikroORM

[MikroORM](https://mikro-orm.io/) is a TypeScript-first ORM for Node.js, built on the **Data Mapper, Unit of Work, and Identity Map** patterns. It emphasizes type safety, clean architecture, and domain-driven design.

![mikroorm](/content/blog/top-typescript-orm/mikroorm.webp)

**Highlights:**

- Type-safe, decorator-based entity definitions
- Data Mapper for clean domain/data separation
- Unit of Work for change tracking and batching
- Identity Map to avoid duplicate instances
- Powerful query builder and migration system
- Supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, MongoDB

**Code Example:**

```typescript
import { Entity, PrimaryKey, Property } from '@mikro-orm/core';

@Entity()
export class User {
  @PrimaryKey()
  id!: number;

  @Property()
  name!: string;

  @Property({ unique: true })
  email!: string;
}
```

- **Sequelize** is powerful but can be verbose and harder to manage at scale.

### ‚ö° Performance & Serverless

- **Drizzle** is the most lightweight and serverless-friendly.

- **Prisma** performs well but needs Accelerate in serverless.

- **Sequelize** and **MikroORM** have more overhead in serverless environments.

### üåê Ecosystem & Community

- **Sequelize** and **TypeORM** have the largest legacy user base.

- **Prisma** has a thriving modern community and frequent updates.

- **Drizzle** and **MikroORM** are rising fast with strong TypeScript focus.
