## Pricing and Licensing

The pricing and licensing models of MySQL 9.2 and SQL Server 2025 reflect their different market positions and business models, significantly impacting total cost of ownership and deployment decisions.

### Licensing Models

#### MySQL 9.2

MySQL 9.2 employs a dual licensing approach:

- **Open Source License**: GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2

  - Free to use, modify, and distribute
  - Source code modifications must be made available if distributed
  - May not be suitable for some commercial applications due to GPL requirements

- **Commercial License**: For organizations that cannot comply with GPL requirements
  - Removes GPL obligations
  - Includes additional enterprise features
  - Provides official support and indemnification

MySQL's commercial editions are subscription-based, with pricing typically per server rather than per core or per user.

#### SQL Server 2025

SQL Server 2025 is a commercial-only product with various editions and licensing models:

- **Edition-Based Licensing**:

  - Express Edition: Free version with limited features
  - Developer Edition: Free for development and testing (not production)
  - Web Edition: Low-cost edition for web hosting
  - Standard Edition: Mid-tier edition for departmental applications
  - Enterprise Edition: Full-featured edition for mission-critical applications

- **Licensing Models**:
  - Server + Client Access License (CAL): Fixed server cost plus per-user or per-device CALs
  - Per-Core Licensing: Based on the number of CPU cores (sold in 2-core packs)
  - Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG): Subscription-based model with more flexible terms
  - Azure Hybrid Benefit: Allows using on-premises licenses in Azure

SQL Server's licensing is more complex and typically more expensive than MySQL, particularly for high-core-count servers due to the per-core licensing model.
