## What are the criteria?

When evaluating free and open-source Kubernetes dashboard solutions, several key criteria are essential to consider:

- **Open Source:** The software should be freely available and modifiable, allowing for community contributions and transparency.
- **Free:** The software should be free to use, modify, and distribute.

## Kubernetes Dashboard

![k8s-dashboard](/content/blog/top-open-source-kubernetes-dashboard/k8s-dashboard.webp)

Kubernetes Dashboard ([repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard)) is the official web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters. It allows users to manage applications running in the cluster and troubleshoot them, as well as manage the cluster itself.

**Key Features**

- **Cluster Overview:** Displays an overview of cluster health, workloads, and resources.
- **Workload Management:** Create, update, and delete Kubernetes objects such as Deployments, StatefulSets, and Jobs.
- **Pod & Container Monitoring:** View logs, resource consumption, and running status of individual pods.
- **Service & Networking Control:** Manage Services, Ingress, and Network Policies.
- **Storage Management:** View and manage Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Supports authentication and access control using Kubernetes RBAC.

## Headlamp

![headlamp](/content/blog/top-open-source-kubernetes-dashboard/headlamp.webp)

[Headlamp](https://headlamp.dev/) ([repo](https://github.com/headlamp-k8s/headlamp)) an easy-to-use and extensible Kubernetes web UI, which can also be used as a desktop app. It's developed by Kinvolk (now part of Microsoft). It's a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Sandbox project.

Headlamp was created to blend the traditional feature set of other web UIs/dashboards (i.e., to list and view resources) with added functionality.

**Key Features**

- Vendor-independent / generic Kubernetes UI
- Works in-cluster, or locally as a desktop app
- Multi-cluster
- Extensible through plugins
- UI controls reflecting user roles (no deletion/update if not allowed)
- Clean & modern UI
- Cancellable creation/update/deletion operations
- Logs, exec, and resource editor with documentation
- Read-write / interactive (actions based on permissions)

## Lens

![lens](/content/blog/top-open-source-kubernetes-dashboard/lens.webp)

Designed for Developers and DevOps Engineers, [Lens](https://k8slens.dev/) ([repo](https://github.com/lensapp/lens)) provides an intuitive context-aware UI.

<HintBlock type="info">

Lens Desktop was originally an open-source Kubernetes IDE, but the open-source version has been retired and is no longer actively maintained. The Lens Desktop product is now developed and maintained by Mirantis, and contributions to Lens are now made via the Lens Extension API rather than direct modifications to the core product.

**Key Features**

- **Multi-Cluster Management:** Easily manage multiple Kubernetes clusters.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Built-in Prometheus for live CPU, memory, and network metrics.
- **Integrated Terminal:** Direct kubectl access with auto-complete.
- **Workload & Resource Management:** View and control pods, deployments, and services.
- **Helm Chart Support:** Install and manage Helm applications.
- **RBAC & Security Insights:** Manage access roles and detect security issues.
- **Lens Extensions API:** Customize with plugins and integrations.
- **Desktop App:** Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Event Alerts & Troubleshooting:** Get real-time alerts and logs for debugging.
