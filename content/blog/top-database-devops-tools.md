description: Describe the top database devops tools in 2025.
---

Databases are the backbone of modern applications, and managing them effectively is key to smooth development and operations. Traditional methods often can't keep up with the fast-paced, scalable demands of DevOps workflows. Enter Database DevOps tools — they streamline database development, testing, and deployment automation, fostering collaboration between teams while ensuring reliability and compliance.

In this post, we'll dive into some of the top Database DevOps tools, covering CI/CD automation, SQL linting, backup and recovery, data masking, observability, access management, secret management, and all-in-one solutions.


## Liquibase - CLI-based Database CI/CD

As applications evolve, so do their database structures. Managing these changes while preserving data and maintaining compatibility is a challenge.

[Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.com/) is a powerful, CLI-driven tool for database change management. It lets developers version control database changes using SQL, XML, YAML, or JSON, track schema changes with checksums, and automate deployments in CI/CD pipelines. Its declarative approach supports collaboration and maintains a full history of changes across platforms like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.

_Alternatives:_ [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/), [DACPAC (SQL Server)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/data-tier-applications/data-tier-application-overview?view=sql-server-ver16), [skeema (MySQL)](https://www.skeema.io/), [schemachange (Snowflake)](https://www.schemachange.com/)

## SQLFluff - SQL Lint

Writing SQL can be tricky, especially with multiple dialects and complex queries. Tools that help review and fix SQL code can save time and prevent bugs.

SQLFluff is an open source, dialect-flexible and configurable SQL linter. Designed with ELT applications in mind, SQLFluff also works with Jinja templating and dbt. SQLFluff will auto-fix most linting errors, allowing you to focus your time on what matters.

## Database Backup & Recovery

Automating backups and ensuring quick recovery during disasters is crucial. Backup tools fall into two categories:

1. General Solutions: Platforms like [Veeam](https://www.veeam.com/), [Rubrik](https://www.rubrik.com/), and [Actifio](https://www.actifio.com/) offer comprehensive data protection. Veeam excels in VM and hybrid-cloud backup, Rubrik focuses on cloud-native security and automation, and Actifio (integrated with Google Cloud) specializes in efficient copy data management. Together, they provide robust, versatile options for diverse enterprise needs.

2. Vendor-Specific Solutions: Tools like [Percona XtraBackup (for MySQL)](https://www.percona.com/software/percona-xtrabackup) and [Barman (for PostgreSQL)](https://www.barman.org/) are tailored to specific database technologies, offering specialized backup and recovery capabilities.

## Delphix - Data Masking

Data masking is replacing real data with fictitious yet realistic data, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected while maintaining data utility for development and testing purposes.

[Delphix](https://www.delphix.com/) is a leading data management platform known for its robust data masking capabilities. It specializes in creating sanitized, non-sensitive clones of databases for testing and development, ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR and HIPAA. 

_Alternatives:_ [Tonic](https://www.tonic.com/), [Neosync](https://www.neosync.com/)

## Datadog - Database Observability

Database observability is vital for monitoring performance, detecting issues early, and ensuring reliability and security. It provides actionable insights through metrics, logs, and traces, enabling root cause analysis, capacity planning, and cost optimization.

[Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) offers a comprehensive observability platform for cloud-scale applications, providing monitoring for servers, databases, tools, and services through its SaaS-based data analytics platform. Its **Datadog Database Monitor** product specifically addresses database observability, supporting popular databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, and MongoDB, helping teams optimize performance and ensure operational efficiency.

## CyberArk - Database Access Management

Database Access Management (DAM) controls and monitors who can access a database, what they can do, and how they access it. It's a cornerstone of database security and compliance, ensuring only authorized users and applications interact with sensitive data.

[CyberArk](https://www.cyberark.com/) specializes in privileged access management (PAM), protecting high-value targets like privileged accounts and credentials. Its solutions secure access to critical systems, including databases, preventing unauthorized access.

## HashiCorp Vault - Database Secret Management

Database Secret Management securely stores and manages sensitive credentials like usernames, passwords, and connection strings. It automates credential rotation, enforces access controls, and provides auditing for compliance.

[HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) is a leading solution for secret management, offering secure storage, key management, and audit logging. It integrates with cloud platforms and DevOps tools, reducing the risk of data breaches.

## Bytebase - All-in-one Solutions

While the tools mentioned above excel in their respective areas, [Bytebase](https://www.bytebase.com/) stands out as a comprehensive, all-in-one solution for Database DevOps. It is an open-source Database DevSecOps tool that simplifies database change management while focusing on security and compliance. Key features include:

- CI/CD for databases – Automates schema migrations and integrates with GitOps workflows.
- SQL linting – Enforces best practices and prevents SQL anti-patterns.
- Data masking – Provides dynamic masking for interactive queries, enhancing security during database exploration.
- Data access control – Implements granular permissions to restrict database access based on roles and compliance needs.
- Secret management – Supports integration with external secret managers like HashiCorp Vault to securely manage database credentials.

Bytebase is designed for teams looking for an integrated approach to database change management while maintaining strict governance over database access and credentials.
