Database tools are the critical enablers that bridge the diverse needs of developers, database administrators (DBAs), security engineers, and platform engineers, serving as the foundation for managing, optimizing, securing, and governing data systems.
Let's take a look at the database tooling landscape in 2024.

## Starlets

### DataGrip

[DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/), a familiar name in the world of database tools, continues to evolve with the introduction of an [AI Assistant](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/features/ai/) this year.
By integrating AI capabilities, DataGrip can provide schema-aware AI chat, text-to-SQL, SQL rewrite, and more.

### Metis

Being part of the database tooling ecosystem, 2024 is also a pivotal year for us at Bytebase. Beside passing 10K GitHub starts, we launched [Bytebase 3.0](/blog/bytebase-3-0), marking our evolution to a **database DevSecOps** solution, with a strong emphasis on security.

## Acquisitions

While database tooling acquisitions may not grab headlines like high-profile data infrastructure deals—such as [OpenAI’s acquisition of Rockset](https://openai.com/index/openai-acquires-rockset/) or [Databricks’ purchase of Tabular](https://www.databricks.com/blog/databricks-tabular)—they are equally indicative of the industry’s momentum:

- [Snowflake acquires TruEra](https://www.snowflake.com/en/blog/snowflake-acquires-truera-to-bring-llm-ml-observability-to-data-cloud/): TruEra is an AI observability platform for assessing the quality of LLM applications and addressing risks like hallucination, bias, and toxicity.
- [Databricks acquires Lilac](https://www.databricks.com/blog/lilac-joins-databricks-simplify-unstructured-data-evaluation-generative-ai): Lilac is a tool for data scientists and AI researchers to explore, understand, and modify text datasets in a tractable way.
- [Perforce acquires Delphix](https://www.perforce.com/blog/perforce-to-acquire-delphix): Delphix is a data platform specializing in data masking, virtualization, and compliance solutions.
- [Timescale acquires PopSQL](https://www.timescale.com/blog/best-postgresql-gui-popsql-joins-timescale/): PopSQL is a collaborative SQL editor known for its intuitive interface and team-friendly features (also our favorite besides our very own [SQL Editor](/sql-editor/)).

## Farewells

As we reflect on the evolving database tooling landscape, it’s worth acknowledging the bittersweet reality that not all tools achieve longevity, even when they embody innovation and promise.

![ottertune-snaplet](/content/blog/database-tool-review-2024/ottertune-snaplet.webp)

Tools like [OtterTune](https://ottertune.com/), a trailblazer in database tuning, and [Snaplet](https://snaplet.dev/), which streamlined database cloning and sanitization for development environments, stand out as examples of ingenuity.

Though these tools may have ceased operations, their contributions to the ecosystem remain impactful and enduring.

## Parting Words

Database tools are more than just companions to database systems—they are an integral part of the database ecosystem, sometimes outlasting the very technologies they support. As underlying database technologies evolve, these tools adapt and thrive by harnessing new capabilities.

See you in 2025.
