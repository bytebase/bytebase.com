## What are the differences between Bytebase and Metabase?

Bytebase is a database development tool for the developer team, while Metabase is a business intelligence tool for the data team.

Bytebase is designed for developers, DBAs, and platform teams to manage database changes, query access, security. In contrast, Metabase serves as a business intelligence tool, enabling users to craft more insightful data presentations for their teams.

### Product position

- **Metabase**: A business intelligence tool that allows users to create and share data visualizations and analytics dashboards without the need for extensive technical knowledge. It's mainly for data team and business analysts.
  ![mb-position](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/mb-position.webp)

- **Bytebase**: The GitLab/GitHub equivalent for Database DevOps including features such as data change, data query and access control, designed for developers, DBAs, and platform teams.
  ![bb-3-op](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/bb-3-op.webp)

### Installation

- **Metabase**: A standalone executable JAR file and also offers Docker deployment options.

- **Bytebase**: Go-based tool, a self-contained binary with no external dependency. Also provides [Docker](https://docs.bytebase.com/get-started/deploy-with-docker) and [Kubernetes](https://docs.bytebase.com/get-started/deploy-with-kubernetes) deployment.

### Supported databases

- **Metabase**: The **Community plan** supports over 20 databases primarily OLAP like Amazon Athena, BigQuery, and Snowflake, while also supporting OLTP such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.

- **Bytebase**: The **Community plan** supports more than 20 databases covering both SQL databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle, and NoSQL databases including MongoDB, Redshift, and Redis.

### Developer interface

- **Metabase**: A web-based GUI platform that primarily features a query builder and a dashboard builder.
  ![mb-question](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/mb-question.webp)
  ![mb-dashboard](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/mb-dashboard.webp)

- **Bytebase**: A web-based GUI platform that consists of an issue-based change management system and a SQL Editor for querying.
  ![bb-issue](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/bb-issue-waiting.webp)
  ![bb-gui](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/bb-gui.webp)

### Query

- **Metabase**: There're two methods to query data, with both allowing you to visualize results, incorporate them into dashboards, and share with others.

  1. **Question** is used to create a question with interactive blocks, which is good for non-technical users.
     ![mb-question](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/mb-question.webp)

  1. **SQL query** is used to write SQL directly, which is efficient for technical users. Switching to Metadata allows you to inspect database tables and schemas.
     ![mb-sql-query](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/mb-sql-query.webp)

- **Bytebase**: **SQL Editor** is used to execute queries. You can query a table either by double-clicking on a table or by manually writing SQL with the help of auto-completion.

  Compared with Metabase's SQL query, Bytebase's SQL Editor is more like a SQL client, making it a better fit for developers and DBAs.
  ![bb-data-query](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/bb-data-query.webp)

### SQL snippet

- **Metabase**: SQL snippets can be saved, and users with SQL editor permissions for any connected database can create, edit, and manage (archive or unarchive) all snippets. Starting with the **Pro plan**, you may also set permissions for these snippets by organizing them into folders.
  ![mb-snippet](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/mb-snippet.webp)

- **Bytebase**: You may save your scripts or star specific saved scripts for easy access. Starting with the **Pro plan**, you may also share the script with your team.
  ![bb-sheets](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/bb-sheets.webp)

### Visualization

- **Metabase**: Create visualizations and dashboards from your data. You can also create derived tables, called models, that can pull together data from different tables to make your data more intuitive for your teams.
  ![mb-visualization](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/mb-visualization.webp)

- **Bytebase**: Not available. It's more like a SQL client for developers and DBAs to query data. The only visualization is the **Schema Diagram**.
  ![bb-schema-diagram](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/bb-schema-diagram.webp)

### Access control

- **Metabase**: `Admin` can create `Collection` to organize questions, dashboards, models, timelines, and other collections. There are three permission levels available for both collections and data sources: `Curate Access`, `View Access`, and `No Access`. These permissions can be assigned to specific `user groups`.

  ![mb-access-control](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/mb-access-control.webp)

  With **Pro plan**, you can also set up permissions to restrict access to specific rows or columns.

  ![mb-pro-access-control](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/mb-pro-access-control.webp)

- **Bytebase**: Roles are divided into two levels - Workspace and Project. `Workspace Admin`/`DBA` set up database instances and manage members. `Project Owner` handle databases, issues, and members at the Project level. Individuals can hold multiple project-level roles, such as `Project Developer` (change database), and `SQL Editor User` (query database).
  ![bb-access-control](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/bb-access-control.webp)

  With **Community plan**, if one's not assigned to a project, one can't see the project at all. With **Enterprise plan**, `Project Owner` can grant access to specific databases or tables instead of all project databases to a specific `SQL Editor User`. `Project Developer` can also request to query or export a database or table with a request issue.
  ![bb-access-control-adv](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/bb-access-control-adv.webp)

  Additionally, admins can set different data access controls for various environments, such as restricted access to production data and open access to development data.
  ![bb-access-environment](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/bb-access-control-env.webp)

### Data masking

- **Metabase**: Not available. However, access control for specific rows or columns is available with the **Pro plan**. This serves a purpose akin to data masking but is less convenient, adaptable, and secure.

- **Bytebase**: `Admin`/`DBA`/`Project Owner` can configure data masking for specific columns within a table and can also authorize particular users to access the original, unmasked data. `SQL Editor User`, on the other hand, is limited to accessing only the masked data.

  Furthermore, `Admin`/`DBA` can define semantic types for masking algorithms, such as email, phone, credit card, etc. As a result, the data will be masked according to the semantic type configured.
  ![bb-masking-graph](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/bb-masking-graph.webp)

### Audit log

- **Metabase**: **Audit Log** is available for the **Pro** and **Enterprise plan**. It gives admin an overview of how people are interacting with their Metabase.
  ![mb-audit-log](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/mb-audit-log.webp)

- **Bytebase**: **Audit Log** is available for the **Enterprise plan**. It records all the activities within Bytebase which can be filtered or exported.
  ![bb-audit-log](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/bb-audit-log-dropdown.webp)

### Change workflow

- **Metabase**: Not available.

- **Bytebase**: Database change will go through a ticketing process encapsulated as an issue. Issue contains **SQL Review**, **Custom Approval Flow** and other related features.
  ![bb-issue](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/bb-issue-waiting.webp)

  Every change will be recorded in the **Change History**. Bytebase can also detect out-of-band schema changes made by other tools and mark them as **Schema Drift**.
  ![bb-history](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/bb-history.webp)

  If you write a SQL script such `ALTER TABLE` in **SQL Editor**, you'll be prompted to create an issue or switch to **Admin mode** (similar to SSH in the terminal) if you are an admin/DBA role.

## Summary

On the surface, Bytebase and Metabase look similar. Even their naming resembles. While
they are built for different audiences.

- **Metabase** is well-suited for the data teams looking for an intuitive platform for data visualization and analytics.
- **Bytebase**, on the other hand, excels in collaborative database development management, making it suitable for the developer teams.

They often co-exist and together cover the database tooling needs for the organization.
