SQL Server monitoring tools help database administrators track performance, identify bottlenecks, and ensure optimal database health.
In 2025, the top SQL Server monitoring tools include Microsoft's SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), the open-source options DBA Dash and SQLWATCH, Stack Overflow's Opserver, and commercial solutions like Redgate SQL Monitor and Datadog Database Monitoring.

## Built-in Tools within SSMS

[SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) is primarily a tool for managing and administering SQL Server instances, databases, and their associated objects. While SSMS itself is not a dedicated monitoring tool, it does provide some features and integrations that allow DBAs to monitor SQL Server performance and activity:

### The Activity Monitor

**The Activity Monitor** provides real-time insights into SQL Server database performance and health, aiding in troubleshooting, resource monitoring, and ensuring smooth server operation.

### Reports

**Reports** offer disk usage data, performance dashboards, and top queries by CPU, duration, and IO, helping identify resource-intensive queries.

### SQL Server Profiler

**SQL Server Profiler**, though deprecated, is available in older SSMS versions for tracing SQL Server events. **Extended Events** is recommended as a modern alternative.

### Extended Events

**Extended Events** is the replacement for SQL Server Profiler. It's a lightweight, customizable monitoring system for capturing detailed performance and troubleshooting data.

## Open Source Tools

### DBA Dash

[DBA Dash](https://dbadash.com/) is a free, open source monitoring tool for SQL Server. It provides DBAs with insights into the health, performance, and activity of SQL Server instances.

It is particularly useful for small to medium-sized environments where a full-fledged enterprise monitoring solution might be overkill.

- **Performance Monitoring**: CPU, IO, blocking, running queries, slow queries, stored procedures, performance counters, memory, and more.
- **Track Configuration**: Configuration settings, trace flags, hardware, patching, and tempdb across all servers, with automatic change tracking.

### SQLWATCH

[SQLWATCH](https://github.com/marcingminski/sqlwatch) is decentralized, real to near-real time SQL Server monitoring solution. It is designed to provide comprehensive monitoring out of the box and to serve as a monitoring framework for your own projects or applications. It collects performance data in a local database with an option for centralised reporting for convenience.

#### Key Features

- 5-second granularity for capturing workload spikes.
- Grafana for real-time dashboards and Power BI for in-depth analysis.
- Extensive configuration options.
