In 2025, SQL Server monitoring tools continue to evolve, offering a range of options to suit different needs and environments. In this article, we explore the top SQL Server monitoring tools, covering built-in, open source, and commercial solutions.

## Built-in Tools within SSMS

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is primarily a tool for managing and administering SQL Server instances, databases, and their associated objects. While SSMS itself is not a dedicated monitoring tool, it does provide some features and integrations that allow DBAs to monitor SQL Server performance and activity:

### The Activity Monitor

**The Activity Monitor** provides real-time insights into SQL Server database performance and health, aiding in troubleshooting, resource monitoring, and ensuring smooth server operation.

### Reports

**Reports** offer disk usage data, performance dashboards, and top queries by CPU, duration, and IO, helping identify resource-intensive queries.

### SQL Server Profiler

**SQL Server Profiler**, though deprecated, is available in older SSMS versions for tracing SQL Server events. **Extended Events** is recommended as a modern alternative.

### Extended Events

**Extended Events** is a lightweight, customizable monitoring system for capturing detailed performance and troubleshooting data.
