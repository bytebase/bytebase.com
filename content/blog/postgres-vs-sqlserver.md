## Why Comparing PostgreSQL and SQL Server

When comparing PostgreSQL and SQL Server, we're examining two enterprise-class database systems with different business models but similar capabilities. SQL Server represents the commercial approach with licensing costs and Microsoft ecosystem integration, while PostgreSQL offers comparable enterprise features (high availability, security, advanced SQL capabilities) as an open-source solution without licensing fees.

This similarity in target applications, combined with PostgreSQL's feature parity and growing enterprise support ecosystem, makes it the natural first choice when organizations consider migrating away from SQL Serverâ€”offering a path to reduce licensing costs while maintaining enterprise-grade database capabilities.

This comparison reflects the current state of both systems as of 2025, including the latest versions: PostgreSQL 17.4 (with PostgreSQL 18 on the horizon) and SQL Server 2025 (currently in preview):

## Pricing and Licensing

### PostgreSQL Licensing Model

PostgreSQL is released under the PostgreSQL License, a liberal open-source license similar to the BSD or MIT licenses.

### SQL Server Licensing Models and Pricing

_Based on the latest [SQL Server 2022 pricing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2022-pricing)_

**1. Core-Based Licensing**

| Edition             | Price (USD) | Licensing Unit |
| ------------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Enterprise          | $15,123     | 2-core pack    |
| Standard (per core) | $3,945      | 2-core pack    |
| Standard (server)   | $989        | Server         |
| Standard (CAL)      | $230        | CAL            |
| Developer           | Free        | Per user       |
| Express             | Free        | Not applicable |

**Key Considerations for Core-Based Licensing:**

- Minimum requirement of 4 cores per physical processor
- All cores in the physical processor must be licensed
- Enterprise Edition includes unlimited virtualization rights
- Software Assurance required for License Mobility

**2. Server + CAL Licensing**

- Server license: $989 per server instance
- Client Access Licenses (CALs): $230 per user or device

**3. Modern Cloud-Based Pricing**

**Azure Arc-Enabled Pay-As-You-Go:**

| Edition             | Monthly Rate (USD) | Hourly Rate (USD) |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Standard per core   | $73                | $0.100            |
| Enterprise per core | $274               | $0.375            |

**Subscription-Based Pricing:**

| Edition               | Annual Price (USD) | Licensing Unit |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| SQL Server Enterprise | $5,434             | 2-core pack    |
| SQL Server Standard   | $1,418             | 2-core pack    |

## Future Outlook

**PostgreSQL 18 (Expected September 2025):**

- Query optimizer improvements including Hash Right Semi Join implementation
- 40% reduction in memory usage for joins with large datasets
- 15% faster execution times for EXISTS subqueries
- Enhanced logical replication capabilities
- Improved parallel query execution
- Better integration with cloud environments

**SQL Server 2025 (Currently in Preview):**

- Deep AI integration with built-in vector database capabilities
- Enhanced security features including Microsoft Entra managed identities
- Performance improvements including optimized locking
- Intelligent Query Processing enhancements
- Stronger cloud integration with Microsoft Fabric and Azure Arc

## Conclusion

PostgreSQL and SQL Server represent two different philosophies in database management systems: the open-source, community-driven approach versus the commercial, integrated ecosystem approach. Both systems have evolved significantly and offer robust, enterprise-grade features in 2025.

**PostgreSQL Advantages:**

- Zero licensing costs with a permissive open-source license
- Extensive data type support and extensibility
- Growing popularity and community support
- Freedom from vendor lock-in

**SQL Server Advantages:**

- Deep integration with Microsoft's ecosystem
- Advanced business intelligence and analytics capabilities
- Comprehensive enterprise features out-of-the-box

As both systems continue to evolve, they are likely to address their respective weaknesses while building on their strengths. PostgreSQL is gaining more enterprise features and commercial support options, while SQL Server is becoming more open and flexible with Linux support and containerization.
