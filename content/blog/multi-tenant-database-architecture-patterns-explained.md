description: A deep dive into multi-tenant database architecture patterns, exploring pros and cons of shared vs. isolated models, and how to choose the right approach for your SaaS application.
---

We frequently hear from prospects about their schema migration challenges. One of the top pain points is managing schemas where they employ a single DB per tenant architecture.

When building a SaaS application, determining the optimal database architecture for multi-tenancy is a pivotal decision that significantly influences scalability, security, cost-efficiency, and operational complexity. The architectural spectrum ranges from shared-everything models, where tenants share databases, schemas, and tables, to shared-nothing approaches, where each tenant has dedicated resources.

It's a recurring topic asked like in this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/1j7682a/multitenant_database/):

## Multi-Tenant Database Architecture Patterns

Let's explore the common patterns for multi-tenant database architectures:

### Pattern 1: Shared Everything - Shared Database, Shared Schema

In this model, all tenants share the same database and the same tables. This is achieved by adding a `tenant_id` column to each table that requires tenant separation.

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  tenant_id INT NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  email VARCHAR(255),
  ...
  INDEX(tenant_id)
);
```

**Pros:**

- Simplest and most cost-effective approach
- Easier maintenance - single database to back up, monitor, and update
- Simplified schema management - changes apply to all tenants

**Cons:**

- Risk of data leaks between tenants if queries aren't properly filtered
- Limited tenant isolation. Performance can be affected by "noisy neighbors"
- One-size-fits-all approach limits customization per tenant

### Pattern 2: Shared Database, Separate Schemas

<HintBlock type="info">

Only applicable to database engines supporting separate schemas like PostgreSQL, SQL Server.

</HintBlock>

This pattern uses a single database but creates a separate schema for each tenant.

```sql
-- Create schema for Tenant 1
CREATE SCHEMA tenant1;

-- Create tables in Tenant 1's schema
CREATE TABLE tenant1.customers (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  email VARCHAR(255),
  ...
);

-- Create schema for Tenant 2
CREATE SCHEMA tenant2;

-- Create tables in Tenant 2's schema
CREATE TABLE tenant2.customers (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  email VARCHAR(255),
  ...
);
```

**Pros:**

- Better separation between tenants while still sharing database resources
- Lower risk of data leaks compared to shared tables
- Cost-effective - still only one database to manage
- Supports tenant-specific customizations

**Cons:**

- Schema migrations must be applied to each tenant schema
- Database object limits may become an issue with many tenants
- Resource contention still possible at the database level
- Backup/restore complexity increases

### Pattern 3: Database-per-Tenant

In this pattern, each tenant gets their own dedicated database.

```sql
-- Create Tenant 1's database
CREATE DATABASE tenant1;

-- Create Tenant 2's database
CREATE DATABASE tenant2;
```

**Pros:**

- Maximum tenant isolation
- Easier customization per tenant
- No "noisy neighbor" problems
- Simpler compliance with data residency requirements
- Easier to scale individual tenants

**Cons:**

- Highest operational complexity
- Most expensive in terms of resources
- Schema migrations must be applied across all tenant databases
- Resource underutilization for smaller tenants
- Database connection management becomes more complex

### Summary

| Dimension                  | Shared Database, Shared Schema                                         | Shared Database, Separate Schemas            | Database per Tenant                            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Database Support**       | ✅ All database systems                                                | ❓ PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle            | ✅ All database systems                        |
| **Regulatory Compliance**  | ❌ Most difficult for strict compliance needs                          | ❓ May meet requirements with careful design | ✅ Easiest to meet data residency requirements |
| **Operational Complexity** | ✅ Low; simplest deployment model                                      | ❌ High; one instance, many schemas          | ❌ High; many instances to manage              |
| **Schema Customization**   | ❌ Difficult; typically requires Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) patterns | ❌ Limited customization possible            | ✅ Complete freedom per tenant                 |
| **Scalability**            | ❌ Must scale entire database                                          | ❌ Must scale entire database                | ✅ Can scale individual tenants                |

We recommend avoiding the **Shared Database, Separate Schemas** approach because it introduces complexity comparable to **Database per Tenant** without offering sufficient isolation to meet stringent regulatory compliance requirements.

When starting your greenfield project, the **Database per Tenant** model should only be chosen if your business demands strict regulatory compliance in day 1.

In summary, our guidance is to adopt the **Shared Database, Shared Schema** approach whenever possible. Only transition to **Database per Tenant** if compliance, scalability, or customization requirements necessitate it. Avoid **Shared Database, Separate Schemas**, as it combines the drawbacks of both models without delivering significant benefits.

## Schema Migration Best Practices with Multiple Tenants

Schema migrations are inherently challenging, and if you opt for the **Database per Tenant** model, the complexity increases significantly:

1. **Change History**: Keeping track of schema versions across many tenant databases.
1. **Coordinated Deployment**: Ensuring changes are applied consistently across all tenant databases.
1. **Rollbacks**: Managing failed migrations becomes exponentially more complex.
1. **Tenant-Specific Customizations**: Handling deviations in schema between tenants.
1. **Testing**: Validating migrations across representative tenant databases.

To tackle this, you should adopt best practices:

1. **Version Control for Migration Scripts**

   - Store all migration scripts in version control systems
   - Use sequential versioning (e.g., V1, V2) or timestamp-based versioning
   - Never modify committed migration scripts

1. **Automated SQL Analysis in CI Pipeline**

   - Configure SQL linters to run on every migration script
   - Block PRs that introduces risky patterns by failing the CI pipeline

1. **Idempotent Migrations**

   - Design migrations to be safely re-runnable
   - Include checks like `IF NOT EXISTS` for table creation
   - Use transactions where possible to ensure atomicity

1. **Staged Rollout Strategy**

   - Test migrations on development/staging environments first
   - Deploy to a small subset of tenants (canary deployment)
   - Monitor for issues before full deployment

1. **Backward Compatibility**

   - Design schema changes to support both old and new application versions
   - Consider using database views for compatibility layers
   - Implement multi-phase migrations for breaking changes

1. **Tenant Metadata Registry**

   - Maintain a central registry of all tenant databases
   - Track current schema version for each tenant
   - Record migration history and status
