When resolving production issues, developers often need quick access to databases but lack standing privileges due to security policies. Just-in-Time (JIT) database access provides temporary, controlled access when necessary.

Bytebase and StrongDM are popular solutions for implementing JIT database access control. This article compares their features to help you choose the right tool.

## What Bytebase and StrongDM have in common

- Both can solve database Just-in-time access problem.
- Both provide APIs for you to integrate with your existing system.

## What are the differences between Bytebase and StrongDM?

While both Bytebase and StrongDM are tools that can solve database Just-in-time access problem, there are some key differences between the two.

### Product position

- **StrongDM**: A comprehensive privileged access management (PAM) platform that provides secure access control across infrastructure components including databases, servers, Kubernetes clusters and cloud platforms.

  ![strongdm-position](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-strongdm/strongdm-position.webp)

- **Bytebase**: An all-in-one solution for database development lifecycle management, combining change, query, security and governance.

  ![bytebase-position](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-flyway/bytebase-position.webp)

### Open source or not

- **StrongDM**: Not open source.
- **Bytebase**: Open source. All the code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bytebase/bytebase).

### Installation

- **StrongDM**:  Requires multiple components:
  1. Admin Portal: Administrators need an account to access the web-based admin interface
  1. Gateway & Relay Infrastructure:
     - Gateways: Need to be deployed to handle client connections
     - Relays: Required for connecting to protected resources
  1. Configuration: Admins must configure resources and access controls through the Admin UI
  1. Client Software: Each end user must install the StrongDM client application
  
  ![strongdm-installation](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-strongdm/strongdm-installation.webp)

- **Bytebase**: [Docker](/docs/get-started/self-host/#docker/) is the recommended installation method (one command to install and start). Also supports [Kubernetes](/docs/get-started/self-host/#kubernetes/) deployment and standalone binary installation. Only admin needs to do the setup, client can visit the web-based GUI directly in the browser.

  ![bytebase-installation](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-strongdm/bytebase-installation.webp)

### Developer interface

- **StrongDM**: A web-based GUI and a command-line tool. It also offers Application Programming Interface (API) and Terraform Provider.
- **Bytebase**: A web-based GUI tool. It also provides [API](/docs/api/overview/) and [Terraform Provider](/docs/get-started/terraform/).

### Supported databases

- **StrongDM**: 30+ SQL and NoSQL databases - besides MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server, ClickHouse, MongoDB, Redis, Redshift, Snowflake, also support DB2 and Sybase.
- **Bytebase**: 22 SQL and NoSQL databases - MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server, ClickHouse, MongoDB, Redis, Redshift, Snowflake and etc.

### Permission model

- **StrongDM**: Has four permissions levels to manage the resources.
  
  User access is controlled through role assignments, which are defined by access rules:
  - Static rules: Manually assigned specific permissions
  - Dynamic rules: Automated permissions based on tags and resource types

- **Bytebase**: Implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with two permission levels: Workspace Level and Project Level.
  
  Granular permissions are assigned to Roles, which can then be granted to Users and Groups. Access rights such as data querying, data modification and data export can be configured for specific databases and limited to defined time periods. Permission details such as expiration time are stored in CEL (Common Expression Language).

### SQL client

- **StrongDM**: Need to install an external SQL client, e.g. DBeaver, DataGrip, etc.
- **Bytebase**: Has a built-in SQL client - SQL Editor which is a web-based GUI tool. Besides data query, it supports SQL data masking, data export, data sharing and more.

### Data masking

- **StrongDM**: Does not natively support data masking. Its role-based policies can somehow limit exposure of sensitive data. For example, grant read-only access to non-sensitive columns while blocking access to PII (e.g., SSNs).
- **Bytebase**: Has a built-in dynamic data masking feature which can mask sensitive data in SQL Editor based on the context. You may define semantic types with masking rules and apply them in global level or column level. You may also define masking exemption for specific user or group.

### Approval flow

- **StrongDM**: Specify approvers while defining secure access policy.

  ![strongdm-approval](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-strongdm/strongdm-approval.webp)

- **Bytebase**: Risk-based auto matched approval flow. You can define different risk levels for each operation types (DML, DDL, Create Database, Request Query, Request Export) with custom rules. Once an issue matches the risk conditions, it will be assigned to the corresponding risk level you've defined.

  ![bytebase-approval](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-strongdm/bytebase-approval.webp)

### Audit log

- **StrongDM**: Every action within the StrongDM application is logged. This includes every User authentication, query, SSH, and RDP command as well as administrator actions such as permission changes.

- **Bytebase**: Records all the activities within the platform including not only administrative actions such as grant permissions but also login, query, change and more.

## Summary

Bytebase and StrongDM both offer effective Just-in-Time (JIT) database access control. StrongDM is a comprehensive PAM platform providing secure access across various infrastructure components with a robust permission model, though it requires multiple components and an external SQL client. Bytebase focuses on the database development lifecycle, featuring a built-in SQL client, dynamic data masking, and a risk-based approval flow. It's open source and easy to install. Choose based on your specific needs.
