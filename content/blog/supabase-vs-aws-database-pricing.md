When choosing a PostgreSQL database platform, whether for a side project or a production app, you need to look beyond features and assess the **real cost of running your database**. This includes **compute, storage, backups, and bandwidth**.

In this guide, we compare **Supabase vs AWS (RDS and Aurora)** across **free, entry-level, and production tiers**. We focus strictly on database-related costs and explain **on-demand vs reserved pricing** where applicable.

## 0. Free Plans: What Do You Get for \$0?

Both platforms offer free options, but they differ in **duration**, **compute power**, and **included storage**.

| Feature      | Supabase Free Tier     | AWS Free Tier (12 months)  |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Duration     | Forever                | 12 months from signup      |
| Compute      | Shared CPU (500MB RAM) | 750 hrs/month on t4g.micro |
| Storage (DB) | 500MB                  | 20GB gp2                   |
| Backup       | 7-day snapshot         | 20GB snapshot              |
| Bandwidth    | 5GB                    | 15GB outbound              |

- **Supabase Free** is a generous forever-free plan suited for hobby apps, portfolios, and dev testing.
- **AWS Free Tier** is more powerful but limited to 12 months, ideal if you're testing AWS or already in that ecosystem.

## 1. Entry-Level (Always Free or Low Cost)

Once you outgrow the free plan but don't need heavy production power, both platforms offer entry-level options. AWS RDS adds an interesting twist: you can **reserve instances** to get a big discount for long-term use.

| Feature             | Supabase Pro Tier            | AWS RDS t4g.micro (On-Demand)       | AWS RDS t4g.micro (1yr Reserved) |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Monthly Price       | \$25 (includes \$10 compute) | \$11.68                             | \$6.69                           |
| Compute             | 1GB RAM                      | 1 vCPU / 1GB RAM                    | 1 vCPU / 1GB RAM                             |
| DB Storage Included | 8GB                          | 20GB                                | 20GB                             |
| Extra Storage       | \$0.125/GB                   | \$0.115/GB                          | \$0.115/GB                       |
| Backups             | 7 days included              | Free up to DB size, then \$0.095/GB | Free up to DB size, then \$0.095/GB                             |
| Bandwidth           | 250GB included               | \$0.09/GB outbound                  | \$0.09/GB outbound               |

- Supabase is **simpler and predictable**, good for developers who don’t want to fiddle with AWS details.
- **RDS Reserved** makes AWS cheaper long-term but **requires upfront planning** and commitment.

## 2. Mid-Tier Production: 100GB Storage + Moderate Usage

For applications in active use, say 100GB storage and regular traffic, you start to see **meaningful differences** in how pricing stacks up.

| Feature           | Supabase (Large) | RDS m5.large (On-Demand) | RDS m5.large (1yr Reserved) | Aurora r5.large |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------- | --------------- |
| Compute           | \$110            | \$130                    | \$81                        | \$211           |
| 100GB Storage     | \$12.50          | \$11.50                  | \$11.50                     | \$10            |
| Backups           | Included         | Free (up to DB size)     | Free (up to DB size)                        | \$0.021/GB      |
| Bandwidth (500GB) | \$22.50          | \$45                     | \$45                        | \$45            |
| **Total/Month**   | **\$145**        | **\$186**                | **\$138**                   | **\$266**       |

- Supabase bundles more services into a flat monthly fee, good for predictable budgeting.
- RDS reserved instances save **\~25-30%**, making it a great option for apps with stable, long-term workloads.
- Aurora is for apps needing **extremely high performance**, though at a cost.

## 3. Scaling Up: 500GB+ Storage, Heavy Compute

Now let’s model **serious workloads**: a database with large storage, high uptime, and frequent read/write operations.

| Feature              | Supabase 2XL | RDS r5.xlarge (On-Demand) | RDS r5.xlarge (1yr Reserved) | Aurora I/O-Optimized |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Compute              | \$410        | \$422                     | \$246                        | \$422                |
| 500GB Storage        | \$62.50      | \$57.50                   | \$57.50                      | \$50                 |
| IOPS / Throughput    | Included     | \$100+ (io1 est.)         | \$100+                       | Included             |
| Backup (500GB extra) | Included     | \$47.50                   | \$47.50                      | \$10.50              |
| Bandwidth (1TB)      | \$67.50      | \$90                      | \$90                         | \$90                 |
| **Total/Month**      | **\$540**    | **\$717**                 | **\$541**                    | **\$572**            |

- At scale, **RDS Reserved and Supabase 2XL are neck-and-neck** on cost.
- Supabase remains simpler; RDS offers more control over tuning IOPS, backups, and encryption.
- Aurora shines for **mission-critical apps** needing fast failover, multi-region, or high concurrency.

## Cost Reference for Storage & Compute

| Metric        | Supabase     | AWS RDS (On-Demand) | AWS RDS (Reserved) | Aurora                |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Storage       | \$0.125/GB   | \$0.115/GB          |  \$0.115/GB               | \$0.10–\$0.225/GB     |
| Backup        | Included     | \$0.095/GB          | \$0.095/GB              | \$0.021/GB (snapshot) |
| Bandwidth     | 250GB incl.  | \$0.09/GB outbound  | \$0.09/GB outbound             | \$0.09/GB outbound                |
| Compute Range | \$10–\$3,730 | \$11–\$1,688        | \$6–\$1,080        | \$67–\$3,376          |

- **Reserved pricing** can reduce compute cost by 30–60%, especially for year-long or 3-year commitments.
- Aurora charges **by I/O operations**, unless you're on their newer I/O-optimized pricing model.

## Final Recommendations

| Use Case                           | Best Choice      | Why                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Free hobby project                 | Supabase Free    | No time limit, zero config                        |
| Low-cost dev/test DB               | Supabase Pro     | Simple, includes bandwidth                        |
| AWS trial or AWS-focused team      | AWS Free Tier    | Best compute/storage combo for 1 year             |
| Cost-sensitive production workload | **RDS Reserved** | Big savings if long-term stable usage             |
| Simple mid-sized app               | Supabase or RDS  | Depends on whether you want simplicity or control |
| High write/read throughput         | Aurora           | Built for performance at scale                    |
| Multi-region / enterprise scale    | Aurora or RDS    | Multi-AZ, replication, fine-grained tuning        |
| No-ops, no-config DB experience    | Supabase         | Just works, no DBA needed                          |

## Conclusion

- **Supabase** offers **simple pricing and easy setup**, ideal for fast-moving projects.
- **AWS RDS Reserved** is best for **long-term, cost-optimized workloads** with more control.
- **Aurora** suits **high-performance, high-availability needs**, but at a higher cost.

Choose based on your need for **simplicity vs control**, and how stable your usage will be. Supabase works well for early-stage apps; AWS shines for scaled, mature systems.
