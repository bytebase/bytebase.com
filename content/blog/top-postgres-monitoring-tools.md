> If you don't monitor Postgres, you are not serious.

It's year 2024 and Postgres is keeping the momentums. The rise of [pg_vector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and [Neon](https://neon.tech/) fuel the Postgres adoption. This post reviews the tools and best practices for monitoring your Postgres database.

## Open-source Tools

### pg_stat_statements

The first thing is to enable the `pg_stat_statements` extension.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
```

`pg_stat_statements` tracks planning and execution statistics of all SQL statements executed by a server. It's
also a prerequisite for other more advanced monitoring solutions.

```shell
psql=# SELECT query, calls, total_exec_time, rows, 100.0 * shared_blks_hit /
               nullif(shared_blks_hit + shared_blks_read, 0) AS hit_percent
          FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC LIMIT 5;
-[ RECORD 1 ]---+--------------------------------------------------â€‹------------------
query           | UPDATE pgbench_tellers SET tbalance = tbalance + $1 WHERE tid = $2
calls           | 3000
total_exec_time | 20756.669379
rows            | 3000
hit_percent     | 100.0000000000000000
```

### explain.dalibo.com

![dalibo](/content/blog/top-postgres-monitoring-tools/dalibo.webp)

[explain.dalibo.com](https://explain.dalibo.com/) is a web UI to visiualize the Postgres EXPLAIN query plans.
It's also [open sourced on GitHub](https://github.com/dalibo/pev2) and can be embedded into your own web applications.

### Prometheus Postgres Exporter

[Prometheus Postgres Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-community/postgres_exporter) extract Postgres database metrics and store them in Prometheus. From there, you can use Prometheus Alertmanager to configure alerting rules
and use Grafana to create dashboards.

## Proprietary Solutions

### pganalyze

![pganalyze](/content/blog/top-postgres-monitoring-tools/pganalyze.webp)

[pganalyze](https://pganalyze.com/) is a Postgres specific observability service. It provides in-depth SQL tuning
and performance monitoring. For the Scale plan, it starts with $399 per month including 4 database servers, each
additional server costs $100.

### DataDog

![datadog](/content/blog/top-postgres-monitoring-tools/datadog.webp)

DataDog provides [Postgres Database Monitoring](https://docs.datadoghq.com/database_monitoring/setup_postgres/selfhosted/). Its Postgres monitoring is not as extensive as pganalyze. DataDog's advantage is its integration
with the entire application stack and the CI/CD pipeline. The price starts at $70 per database server per month.

### Other Options

- [pgDash](https://pgdash.io/) has a similar feature set and pricing point to pganalyze. pgDash looks less
  polished. On the other hand, pgDash offers self-hosted option for all plans, whereas pganalyze only offers self-hosted option for the Enterprise plan.

  ![pgdash](/content/blog/top-postgres-monitoring-tools/pgdash.webp)

- [SolarWinds Database Performance Monitor (DPM)](https://www.solarwinds.com/database-performance-monitor) also provides Postgres database performance solution. Its technology comes from the VividCortex acquisition. It's cloud-only and has a steep starting price from $3,096.

## Best Practices

### Monitor Transaction ID Wraparound

Due to PostgreSQL's MVCC implementation, it has an infamous [transaction ID wraparound](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/routine-vacuuming.html#VACUUM-FOR-WRAPAROUND) risk. When this happens, it will render the entire
database unavailable, see some past incidents \([Sentry](https://blog.sentry.io/transaction-id-wraparound-in-postgres/), [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/what-we-learned-from-the-recent-mandrill-outage/), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/blog/post-mortem-service-disruption-on-january-21-22-2020/)\). Every capable Postgres monitoring service and database service provider can check this risk:

- [pganalyze checks every 30 minutes](https://pganalyze.com/docs/checks/vacuum/txid_wraparound)
- [Implement an Early Warning System for Transaction ID Wraparound in Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/implement-an-early-warning-system-for-transaction-id-wraparound-in-amazon-rds-for-postgresql/)
- [GCP Cloud SQL high-transaction-ID-utilization recommender](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/recommender-high-transactionid-utilization)

### Monitoring Locks

Use [pg_locks](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-locks.html) view to find any lock problems. You can
find connections that have held locks for a long time as well as connections that have waited too long to acquire the lock.

You should also consider enabling [log_lock_waits](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-logging.html#GUC-LOG-LOCK-WAITS).

### Avoid Blocking Operations

It's always a good practice to set [lock_timeout](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-LOCK-TIMEOUT) on the user.

When making DDL changes, try to use non-blocking statements. e.g. add index with [CONCURRENTLY](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createindex.html), add constraint with [NOT VALID](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-altertable.html#SQL-ALTERTABLE-DESC-ADD-TABLE-CONSTRAINT).

<HintBlock type="info">

You can configure [SQL Review](https://docs.bytebase.com/sql-review/overview/) in Bytebase and detect such anti-patterns.

</HintBlock>

### Use a Cloud Postgres Service Provider

Every major Postgres database service provider has basic monitoring out of the box. If you have to self-host
due to budget or compliance reasons, then you can start with Prometheus/Grafana setup and upgrade to
pganalyze/DataDog as business grows.
