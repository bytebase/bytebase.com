Database management tools simplify the process of managing data and databases, improve performance, and provide functionalities for data analysis. They are essential tools for organizations dealing with large volumes of data and ease the process of database management, development, and administration.

[DBeaver](https://dbeaver.com/) is one of the most popular database management tools out there. Take a look at the Google Trends chart of the search term "DBeaver" as compared to two of its alternatives over the past 12 months, it's obvious that DBeaver is easily the most searched of the trio by a trifold.

A quick intro to DBeaver if you are not familiar: it offers both open-source (free) and commercial products. DBeaver started out way back in 2010, and 10 years later, it boasts more than 8 million users, of which 5,000+ paying customers. Earlier this year, they also [announced](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/11/dbeaver-takes-6m-seed-investment-to-build-on-growing-popularity) a seed funding round of $6M. Safe to say that they are not slowing down anytime soon.

Of course, there are other database management tools on the market. If for some reason, DBeaver doesn't fulfill your requirements or you are just in the mood to try something new - here, we are taking a look at top DBeaver alternatives.

## Navicat

[Navicat](https://navicat.com/) is probably the most similar to DBeaver. It was initially released in 2002 as a simple app for MySQL on Windows. 20 years later, it now supports macOS and Linux and a handful of mainstream databases.

The difference between Navicat and DBeaver lies in their target audience and pricing models: Navicat is designed for commercial users and enterprises (yet [they don't provide sufficient data access control, data masking, or centralised control over password for database security](/blog/stop-using-navicat/)), while DBeaver is an open-source tool that caters to a wider range of users, from individual developers to SMEs. This difference is also visible in that Navicat uses a commercial licensing model, while DBeaver has both open-source (free) and commercial products.

## DbVisualizer

[DbVisualizer](https://www.dbvis.com/) supports a long list of databases including MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, ClickHouse, MongoDB, SQLite, to SAP, and more. It is available on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Unix platforms. It comes with a powerful SQL editor with support for auto-completion, visual query builder, SQL formatter, inline data editing, CLI-based interface, and efforts on security including SSH, local password.

You can use DbVisualizer for free, or unlock all features plus technical support by purchasing a subscription. The subscription is seat-based (the more users, the more seat licenses you will need).

DbVisualizer and DBeaver have similar core functionalities, such as SQL querying, database exploration, object management, and data visualization. But DbVisualizer offers more comprehensive data analysis tools, while DBeaver excels in database administration tasks with a broader range of tools and features for advanced database management.

## TablePlus

[TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) is a modern, lightweight, and intuitive database management tool fit for macOS, Windows, and Linux. It offers an easy-to-use interface for managing various relational and a few NoSQL databases.

![](/content/blog/top-dbeaver-alternative/tableplus.webp)

Currently, TablePlus offers two plans: a free tier with no trial time (but only limited features are available) and a paid subscription model that provides extended features.

TablePlus is not open-source, but the team's side product is - DBngin, which can [spin up a local database](/blog/free-tools-to-start-local-database-on-mac/) (Postgres, MySQL, or Redis) quite easily on your Mac, it can then be connected to TablePlus to visually manage your local databases.

Another major difference between TablePlus and DBeaver is their target audience: TablePlus is more geared towards individual developers or small teams who seek a handy database management tool. In comparison, DBeaver targets a wider range of users with more database support and additional advanced features, from individual developers, to DBAs, and enterprises.

## DataGrip

[DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/) is a database IDE developed by JetBrains (the company behind popular IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA and PhpStorm) for developers and DBAs.

DataGrip excels in providing a feature-rich, user-friendly, and powerful IDE for database development and administration. Other than the list of relational and NoSQL databases it supports, DataGrip includes an intelligent SQL editor, data compare to view schema diff, along with VCS support for GitHub.

It is not open-source and operates on a commercial licensing model, requiring a paid license for usage, but offers a 30-day trial.

DataGrip is part of the JetBrains ecosystem, offering integration with other JetBrains tools and frameworks to provide a cohesive experience with other JetBrains IDEs. So it's perfect if you prefer a dedicated IDE with comprehensive database management features.

## Beekeeper Studio

[Beekeeper Studio](https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/) is a modern and lightweight SQL client that supports MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, SQL Server, CockroachDB, etc. And it runs on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

The sleek and minimalistic UI comes from the frustration that other open-source SQL editors and database management tools added so many features that the UI becomes cluttered and hard to navigate. And Beekeeper Studio is created - one that's simple yet feature-rich with all the necesities, but also easy to use.

It has two editions:

- Beekeeper Studio - the full version with all the features.
- Beekeeper Studio Community Edition: the open-source version, and free to use.

## PopSQL

[PopSQL](https://popsql.com/pricing) is a web-based collaborative SQL Editor specifically for modern data teams to collaborate on writing, editing, running, and organizing SQL queries efficiently. PopSQL supports connecting to a variety of databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, SQLite, and others.

Unlike DBeaver or the aforementioned database management tools, PopSQL is not as extensive in database management features, as it focuses specifically on **collaborative SQL editing for data teams**.

![](/content/blog/top-dbeaver-alternative/popsql.webp)

Imagine: if everyone on your team used their own SQL editor, how would they share their work? How can they collaborate on the queries? And what happens to the queries when people move on to another job?

And that's the problem PopSQL is trying to solve. Users can share query results, collaborate in real time, and leave comments to discuss and document their work. Aside from the modern-looking SQL editor, it also offers a data catalog to help understand database schema, query result visualization, and syntax highlighting.

PopSQL offers both free and paid plans. The free plan provides basic features with a limited number of users and queries. The paid plans provide additional features like team collaboration, increased query capacity, and priority support.

## Bytebase

If you have multiple different databases at your organization and are looking for a universal tool that can handle them all while covering database change, query, security, and governance all in one, please check out [Bytebase](/). Aside from the visual [SQL Editor](https://docs.bytebase.com/sql-editor/overview/) integrated with [access control](https://docs.bytebase.com/security/database-permission/overview/) and [data masking](https://docs.bytebase.com/security/data-masking/overview/), it also provides a customizable [change workflow](https://docs.bytebase.com/change-database/change-workflow/) to fit your data/database change requirements.
