DevOps and DevSecOps are methodologies aimed at improving software development and delivery, but they differ in their focus and integration of security.

## Where do DevOps and DevSecOps come from?

- **DevOps** emerged from the need to bridge the gap between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). Its goal is to accelerate development cycles, improve collaboration, and enable continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD).

- **DevSecOps** arose as an extension of DevOps, addressing the growing need of integrating security into fast-paced development cycles. Its goal is to embed security practices early and continuously to reduce risks without slowing down development.

## Key Differences

### Primary Focus

- **DevOps** focuses on the speed and efficiency of software development and delivery.

- **DevSecOps** emphasizes security throughout the development lifecycle.

### Security Integration

- **DevOps** treats security as a separate phase, e.g. penetration testing at the end of a release, along with security reviews.

- **DevSecOps** integrates security into every stage of the development lifecycle, from planning to deployment. Regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) are baked into workflows and automated audits replace manual compliance checks.

### Culture and Mindset

- **DevOps** "You build it, you run it". Developers take ownership of their code in production.

- **DevSecOps** "Security is everyone’s responsibility." Security is non-negotiable and foundational. People in every role integrate security thinking into their daily workflows.

### Toolchains and Technologies

- **DevOps Tools:**

  - **CI/CD:** Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions
  - **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible
  - **Containerization:** Docker, Kubernetes, Helm
  - **Monitoring/Logging:** Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog
  - **VCS:** GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket

- **DevSecOps Tools** (Layered into the pipeline):
  - **Code Scanning:** SonarQube, Snyk Code, Fortify
  - **Security Testing:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Checkov
  - **Runtime Security:** Wiz, Falco, Aqua Security
  - **Policy & Compliance:** Open Policy Agent (OPA), Drata, Vanta

### Speed vs Security Trade-offs

- **DevOps** prioritizes speed. Faster releases, but risk of late-discovered vulnerabilities.

- **DevSecOps** slightly slower but more secure. Catching issues early avoids larger delays and risks later.

## Summary

| Dimension         | DevOps                                                   | DevSecOps                                               |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**         | Speed, automation, and collaboration                     | Speed with integrated security throughout the pipeline   |
| **Security**      | Added late in the cycle (e.g., during final review)       | Embedded in every stage from planning to production      |
| **Mindset**       | “You build it, you run it”                                | “Security is everyone’s responsibility”                  |
| **Tools**         | CI/CD, IaC, container orchestration, monitoring           | All DevOps tools + security scanners, audit tools        |
| **Speed vs Security** | Prioritizes speed, may defer security checks          | Balances speed with continuous security validation       |
