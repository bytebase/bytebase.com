description: Learn how Bytebase enables organizations to implement comprehensive Database Security Lifecycle Management, unifying security and operations from development to production.
---

In today’s software-driven world, teams are moving faster than ever. **Infrastructure** is codified (Terraform, Pulumi, etc.), **Secrets** are rotated (AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, etc.), and **CI/CD** pipelines push changes every hour (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).

But the **database**? It's often the last part of the stack to catch up.

Most database changes are still manual. Access is rarely reviewed. And security? Often reactive — if addressed at all.

We believe it's time to bring **structure, automation, and security** to the database layer — not just for compliance, but for operational sanity.

Over the years, we’ve seen database security challenges evolve — and so has [Bytebase](https://bytebase.com). What has emerged is a unified model we now call **Database Security Lifecycle Management (DSLM)**: a structured approach to managing database **change**, **access**, and **security** from **Day 0 through Day 2**.


## Why DSLM?

Databases power your most critical data — customer records, financials, transactions — and yet:

- Schema changes happen without proper review
- Access is overly broad and rarely revoked
- Sensitive data is left unclassified or unprotected

[Bytebase](/) addresses these challenges head-on with a unified platform that integrates seamlessly into how teams work — combining features like **SQL review**, **batch schema changes**, **approval workflows**, **access control**, **data masking**, and **audit logging** to bring security, governance, and velocity to every stage of your database workflow.

## The Three Lifecycles of DSLM

### 🔁 Change Lifecycle — Plan, review, and deploy safely

Bytebase supports safe and structured schema changes through:

- **SQL review policies**: 100+ built-in rules to detect anti-patterns, enforce best practices, and catch security issues early
- **Approval flows**: define custom approval flows based on environment or project
- **Multi-environment deployment**: auto-promote changes across dev → staging → prod with rollback support
- **One-click rollback**: rollback to previous version with a single click
- **Change history & audit**: every change is logged — who, what, when, and why
- **GitOps workflows**: manage migrations directly from GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps or Bitbucket.

> 🔎 Bytebase supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, MongoDB, TiDB, and more — so you can unify change workflows across your entire database estate.

### 🔐 Access Lifecycle — Just enough access, just in time

Database access in Bytebase is **request-based**, **temporary**, and **auditable**:

- **Role-based access control (RBAC)**: grant per-database, per-project, per-environment permissions
- **Access requests & approvals**: users request access; owners approve — all tracked
- **Auto-expiring access**: grant access for 1 hour, 1 day, or any custom duration
- **Query history & session audit**: see what was queried, by whom, and when
- **SSO integration**: connect to identity providers like Okta, Google, or LDAP for centralized user management

> 📌 This removes the risk of shared accounts and lingering admin access — a common source of data breaches.

### 🛡️ Security Lifecycle — Protect sensitive data and system integrity

Security in Bytebase goes beyond encryption — it's about proactive, policy-based defense:

- **Secrets management**: store DB credentials securely or integrate with AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, or HashiCorp Vault
- **Data masking**: apply column-level masking to protect sensitive data in query results
- **Sensitive data classification**: tag and monitor fields like PII or financial data
- **Audit logging**: every action — schema change, access grant, query execution — is logged for compliance

> 🛡️ Bytebase helps meet SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR, and other regulatory requirements.

## DSLM from Day 0 to Day 2

| Day        | Focus    | 🔁 Change Lifecycle                         | 🔐 Access Lifecycle                   | 🛡️ Security Lifecycle                        |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Day 0**  | Setup    | Connect databases, configure SQL review     | Set up roles, SSO, approval workflows | Secure credentials, classify sensitive data   |
| **Day 1**  | Operate  | Submit changes via UI or Git, deploy safely | Approve requests, auto-expire access  | Enforce masking, monitor policy compliance    |
| **Day 2+** | Maintain | Rollback migrations, audit changes          | Audit usage, revoke idle permissions  | Rotate secrets, adapt to new compliance needs |
