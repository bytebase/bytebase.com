It's been almost 3 years since [we announced Bytebase](/blog/announce-bytebase/). As an open source
project, Bytebase has been growing way faster than the classic [Liquibase](/blog/bytebase-vs-liquibase/) and [Flyway](/blog/bytebase-vs-flyway/). Now it's the only database DevOps and CI/CD tool surpassing 10,000 stars on GitHub.

In recent years, our user base has grown to encompass nearly every region globally, extending as far as Greenland and the Fiji Islands!

Furthermore, the enterprise plan achieved a 100% global renewal rate in 2023. We continue to attract new enterprise clients in 2024, including notable companies like [Linear](https://linear.app) from the US, [PropertyGuru](https://www.propertyguru.com.sg) from Singapore, and [Xendit](https://www.xendit.co) from Indonesia.

Today, Bytebase is the only database tool included by both the [CNCF Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/?selected=bytebase) and [Platform Engineering Landscape](https://platformengineering.org/tools/bytebase).

Our goal stays the same as we started the project, to invent a new category to change, query, secure, govern all different databases inside a single platform, and to bring the GitLab/GitHub experience to developer, DBA and the platform engineering
teams.

Way to go 😎!
