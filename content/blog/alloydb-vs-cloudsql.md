### Supported Databases

**AlloyDB** only supports **PostgreSQL**. It's built for high performance and enterprise use, making it ideal for teams focused solely on PostgreSQL workloads.

**Cloud SQL** supports **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, and **SQL Server**. It's a fully managed option for teams needing flexibility across different database engines.

**Summary:**
Choose **AlloyDB** for top-tier PostgreSQL performance. Choose **Cloud SQL** if you need support for **multiple databases** or prefer a different managed PostgreSQL experience.

### Architecture

**AlloyDB** uses a modern, **cloud-native architecture** with separate compute and storage. This design delivers high performance and scalability for PostgreSQL.

- **Distributed Storage**: Built for PostgreSQL, with auto-scaling, fast I/O, and durable logs.
- **Independent Compute Scaling**: Optimized compute with smart caching for low-latency access.
- **Built-in Columnar Engine**: Supports fast analytics on transactional data (HTAP).
- **ML-Driven Management**: Uses machine learning for tuning, maintenance, and vacuuming.

**Cloud SQL** follows a **traditional managed database** model.

- **Managed VMs**: Fixed-size instances per chosen database engine.
- **Persistent Disks**: SSD or HDD storage, more tightly coupled with compute.
- **High Availability**: Uses synchronous replication with auto-failover.
- **Read Replicas**: Improve read performance and support multi-region replication.

**Summary**:
Choose **AlloyDB** for top-tier PostgreSQL performance, scalability, and analytics.
Choose **Cloud SQL** for a flexible, fully managed service that supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server.

### Compatibility (Simplified)

**AlloyDB** is fully **PostgreSQL-compatible**, designed to work with existing tools, queries, and drivers.

- ✅ Uses PostgreSQL wire protocol – works with JDBC, ODBC, psycopg2, etc.
- ✅ Supports standard PostgreSQL SQL syntax and many popular extensions
- ✅ Compatible with major PostgreSQL versions (e.g., 14, 15)
- ⚠️ Like other managed services, it restricts superuser access and direct file system use

**Cloud SQL** supports high compatibility across three engines:

- **PostgreSQL** – Similar compatibility to AlloyDB
- **MySQL** – Works with common tools and storage engines (e.g., InnoDB)
- **SQL Server** – Supports .NET workloads and common SQL Server features

**Things to Note:**

- 🔍 **Extension support**: Varies between AlloyDB and Cloud SQL — always check if your required extensions are supported
- 🕒 **Feature delays**: Both may lag behind the latest open-source releases
- 🔒 **Managed service limits**: No OS access and limited administrative privileges in both

**Summary:**
If you're using PostgreSQL and want full compatibility plus enhanced performance, **AlloyDB** is a great fit.
If you need flexibility across **PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQL Server**, or require broader engine support, **Cloud SQL** is the better option.

### Performance

**AlloyDB** is built for **high-performance PostgreSQL** workloads—both transactional and analytical.

- 🚀 **Up to 4x faster** than standard PostgreSQL for transactions (thanks to optimized write paths and smart caching)
- 📊 **Up to 100x faster** for analytics with its built-in **columnar engine**
- 📚 Supports many **read replicas** with very low lag (milliseconds)
- 🔁 Delivers **consistent performance** at scale due to its cloud-native architecture

**Cloud SQL** provides **solid, general-purpose performance** across **PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server**.

- ⚙️ Comparable to well-tuned, self-managed databases on cloud VMs
- 💡 Performance boosts available with Enterprise Plus for PostgreSQL
- 🔁 Supports **read replicas** and a variety of **storage types** (SSD, HDD, local SSD)
- 🔧 Performance tuning depends on **instance size** and **storage config**

**Summary:**

Choose **AlloyDB** if you need the **best PostgreSQL performance**, especially for high-throughput or real-time analytics.
Choose **Cloud SQL** for **reliable performance** across **multiple databases** and **customizable infrastructure options**.

### Elasticity

**Elasticity** means how easily a database adjusts compute and storage to match workload demands. Both **AlloyDB** and **Cloud SQL** support elasticity, but AlloyDB is more dynamic - especially for storage.

**AlloyDB** offers **high elasticity** by design:

- 📦 **Storage scales automatically** with data — no need to pre-provision or resize
- 🧠 **Compute resources** (CPU/memory) can be resized quickly (few minutes)
- 📚 **Read replicas** can be added/removed to scale read throughput
- 📊 **Columnar engine** resources are also tunable for analytical load

Best for workloads with **fast-growing or unpredictable storage and read demand**

**Cloud SQL** offers **moderate elasticity** with some manual steps:

- 📦 **Storage auto-growth** expands disk as needed (no downtime), but **cannot shrink** automatically
- 🧠 **Compute scaling** requires instance restart — some downtime
- 📚 **Read replicas** available for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server
- ⚙️ **Serverless options** are emerging but not yet broadly available

Good for **steady workloads** where occasional scaling is acceptable

**Summary:**
Choose **AlloyDB** if you need **seamless storage scaling** and more flexibility with resource management.
Choose **Cloud SQL** for **broad database support** and **reliable**, though slightly more manual, scaling features.

### High Availability

**High Availability (HA)** ensures your database stays online—even during failures or maintenance. Both **AlloyDB** and **Cloud SQL** offer strong HA, but AlloyDB is faster and more seamless.

**AlloyDB**: Built for **99.99% uptime**, even during maintenance.

- ⚡ **Fast failover**: Detects failures and recovers in **under 60 seconds**
- 🌍 **Regional resilience**: Stores data across zones—automatic failover within region
- 🔁 **Rolling maintenance**: Updates with **near-zero downtime**
- 🌐 **Cross-region replication**: Supports disaster recovery with a synced secondary cluster

Best for critical apps needing **fast recovery and minimal disruption**

**Cloud SQL**: Reliable HA for **PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server**

- ⚙️ **Primary + standby** in different zones, with **synchronous replication**
- 🔄 **Automatic failover**: Usually within **a few minutes**
- 💾 **Backups + PITR**: Automated backups and point-in-time recovery
- 🌐 **Cross-region read replicas**: For DR, can be promoted to primary
- 🛠️ **Maintenance windows**: Patches may briefly interrupt service

Solid option for most production apps with **moderate failover tolerance**

**Summary:**
Choose **AlloyDB** for **faster failovers**, **lower maintenance impact**, and **higher SLA**.
Choose **Cloud SQL** for **multi-engine HA** and **proven reliability** across broader use cases.

### Pricing

Both **AlloyDB** and **Cloud SQL** use pay-as-you-go pricing, but AlloyDB is generally a **premium option** focused on performance, while Cloud SQL offers **broader engine support** and more flexible pricing tiers.

**AlloyDB Pricing** – Premium PostgreSQL service

- 📦 **Storage**: Auto-scaling; pay only for what you use (no extra I/O charges)
- 💾 **Backups**: Charged by volume
- 🌐 **Networking**: Outbound traffic billed; in-region often free
- 🛡️ **High Availability**: Increases compute cost (storage is shared across zones)
- 📊 **Columnar Engine**: May add extra cost based on usage

Better price - **performance for high-I/O PostgreSQL workloads** due to smart architecture

**Cloud SQL Pricing** – Flexible for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server

- 💰 **Compute**: Charged by vCPUs and memory; multiple instance types
- 📦 **Storage**: Pay for **provisioned** SSD/HDD (IOPS may affect cost)
- 💾 **Backups**: Charged by size
- 🌐 **Networking**: Egress billed per standard GCP rates
- 🛡️ **High Availability**: Doubles compute/storage (primary + standby)
- 🧾 **SQL Server Licensing**: Included in cost (higher per vCPU)
- 📚 **Read Replicas**: Billed like standalone instances

More **customizable pricing tiers** and multi-engine support (but may require more tuning)

**Summary:**
Use **AlloyDB** for **PostgreSQL-only workloads** needing top performance and efficient scaling—**especially I/O-heavy apps**
Use **Cloud SQL** for **multi-engine support**, flexible pricing tiers, and broader use cases
