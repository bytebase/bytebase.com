_Update: We have also acquired [SOC 2 Type 2](/blog/soc2-type2)_

We are excited to announce that Bytebase has successfully obtained SOC 2 Type 1 certification. This certification validates our commitment to maintaining the highest standards of security, availability, and confidentiality in our database DevSecOps platform.

To achieve and maintain SOC 2 compliance, we partnered with [Vanta](https://www.vanta.com/) for automated security monitoring and compliance.
The audit is conducted by an [independent third party auditor](https://www.assurancelab.cpa/).

The SOC 2 Type 1 report verifies that we have implemented comprehensive security controls and practices to protect customer data. This is just the beginning of our compliance journey as we work towards SOC 2 Type 2 certification.

For more information about our security practices or to request our SOC 2 Type 1 report, please email support@bytebase.com.
