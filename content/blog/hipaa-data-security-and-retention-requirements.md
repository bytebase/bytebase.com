## What is HIPAA

**HIPAA** stands for the **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act**, a U.S. federal law enacted in 1996. Its primary goals are to:

- Protect patient health information (PHI)
- Ensure data privacy and security
- Streamline healthcare data flow and insurance processes

### Key Components of HIPAA

1. **Privacy Rule**
   - Defines standards for who can access and share PHI
   - Applies to healthcare providers, insurers, and their business associates
   - Requires patient consent for most disclosures of health data

2. **Security Rule**
   - Requires safeguards (administrative, physical, and technical) to protect electronic PHI (ePHI)
   - Examples include encryption, access controls, and audit logs

3. **Breach Notification Rule**
   - Mandates notification to individuals, HHS, and media (if applicable) in the event of a data breach

4. **Enforcement Rule**
   - Establishes penalties for non-compliance, with fines up to $1.5 million per violation type annually

### Glossary

| Term     | Meaning                                                                 |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **HIPAA** | Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act                   |
| **PHI**   | Protected Health Information                                           |
| **ePHI**  | Electronic Protected Health Information                                |
| **MFA**   | Multi-Factor Authentication                                            |
| **RBAC**  | Role-Based Access Control                                              |
| **SIEM**  | Security Information and Event Management                              |
| **TDE**   | Transparent Data Encryption                                            |

## Who Must Comply

**Covered Entities:** Health plans, healthcare providers, and clearinghouses that transmit health information electronically.

**Business Associates:** Third-party vendors who handle ePHI on behalf of covered entities, including:

- Cloud database service providers
- Database management tool vendors
- Backup and recovery service providers
- Database consultants

**Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI):** Any identifiable health data maintained or transmitted electronically, such as:

- Medical records
- Billing and insurance data
- Appointment schedules
- Metadata and logs containing patient identifiers

## Security Requirements at the Database Layer

### Access Controls

**Objective:** Ensure only authorized users and applications can access ePHI.

Access control is the cornerstone of HIPAA technical safeguards. It involves restricting data access to only authorized individuals and systems based on their roles and responsibilities.

| Specification           | Database Implementation                   |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **User Identification** | Unique logins linked to organizational ID |
| **Emergency Access**    | Special accounts with audit logging       |
| **Auto Logoff**         | Session timeouts by role                  |
| **Encryption**          | TDE and column-level encryption           |

#### Role-Based Access and Enforcement

Role-based access control (RBAC) assigns permissions based on a user's job function. This minimizes exposure of sensitive data.

- **Clinical roles:** Access to patient data for diagnosis and treatment
- **Administrative roles:** Access to billing and scheduling data
- **Technical roles:** Limited access to manage infrastructure
- **Audit roles:** Read-only access for compliance review

Additional safeguards include:

- View/row/column-level security
- Dynamic data masking for sensitive fields

**Change Management:**

- Standardized access request and approval process
- Non-prod testing
- Documented audit trail
- Quarterly review and cleanup

Bytebase provides **RBAC, just-in-time access, change management, risk-based approval flows, data masking, and audit logging**.

### Audit Controls and Monitoring

**Objective:** Log and monitor all access and activity involving ePHI.

Audit controls are necessary to record access and changes to systems managing ePHI. These logs are crucial for detecting and responding to unauthorized actions and fulfilling regulatory investigations.

- Track user queries, data changes, login attempts, and privilege grants
- Monitor schema updates and configuration changes
- Detect anomalies and violations using alerting systems
- Integrate with SIEM tools for centralized logging and analysis

| Requirement     | Implementation               |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Retention**   | 6+ years with auto-archival  |
| **Protection**  | Write-once, signed logs      |
| **Analysis**    | Use query/reporting tools    |
| **Performance** | Dedicated infra or streaming |

### Data Integrity and Change Management

**Objective:** Prevent unauthorized data alteration or loss.

HIPAA requires organizations to protect data from improper alteration. In databases, this includes:

- Storage-level integrity using checksums and RAID
- Database-level constraints like referential integrity
- Application-level validation and business logic enforcement

Formal change management ensures that updates are reviewed, tested, and documented.

| Change Type | Approval               | Testing           | Timeline  |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| Emergency   | Security officer       | Immediate         | < 4 hrs   |
| Standard    | Technical & compliance | QA testing        | 5–10 days |
| Major       | Executive + full QA    | Regression + perf | 2–4 weeks |

- Risk assessment and rollback plans must be in place

Bytebase provides **change management, risk-based approval flows, rollback and change history**.

### Encryption and Data Protection

**Objective:** Protect ePHI during storage and transmission.

Encryption is a required safeguard under the HIPAA Security Rule.

**At Rest:**

- Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) encrypts the full database without altering the application
- Column-level encryption is used for fields like SSNs or diagnoses
- Encryption keys should be stored in enterprise-grade key management systems with rotation policies

**In Transit:**

- TLS/SSL for all connections
- VPNs or internal certificate-based communication between services

**Change Management:**

- Key rotation schedules
- Algorithm updates and phased rollouts
- Secure handling of encryption configuration changes

<HintBlock type="info">

Bytebase provides **database connection encryption, external secret manager, secret variable and audit logging**.

### Authentication and Authorization

**Objective:** Confirm user identity and enforce privileges.

HIPAA requires strong user authentication to ensure that only approved individuals can access ePHI.

- **MFA:** Combine passwords with tokens or biometrics
- **SSO integration:** Streamlines access and centralizes identity control
- **LDAP/AD support:** Synchronize accounts across platforms
- **Privileged access:** Segregate and monitor admin accounts
- **Regular recertification:** Periodic access reviews

<HintBlock type="info">

Bytebase provides **MFA, SSO, LDAP support, and audit logging**.

## HIPAA Retention Requirements

HIPAA mandates that organizations retain compliance documentation, including audit logs and system configurations, for a minimum of 6 years. However, medical record retention varies by state law.

A data lifecycle management strategy helps fulfill these obligations.

**Implementation Tips:**

- Classify data by type, usage, and legal requirements
- Assign appropriate storage tiers
- Automate archival and deletion workflows
- Enable legal hold features for litigation and investigations

| Tier           | Use                  | Retention | Access                      |
| -------------- | -------------------- | --------- | --------------------------- |
| **Hot**        | Active clinical data | +1 year   | Real-time                   |
| **Warm**       | Recent history       | 2–7 years | Moderate speed              |
| **Cold**       | Archive              | 8+ years  | Occasional                  |
| **Compliance** | Legal mandates       | Per law   | Immutable + verified delete |

### Secure Disposal

When ePHI reaches the end of its lifecycle, it must be permanently and securely removed.

- Logical deletion: Remove data from active systems with verification
- Physical destruction: Shred drives or degauss tapes
- Cryptographic erasure: Destroy encryption keys, rendering data unreadable
- Maintain audit logs for all disposal activities
