description: Top open-source Postgres authentication solutions for 2025.
---

**Postgres has become the go-to database for modern apps. But authentication (who a user is) and authorization (what they can do) are just as critical.**

In 2025, you have plenty of open-source options. To make it simple, here are the most relevant solutions, grouped by type, with clear "best for" recommendations.

## 1. Platforms (Postgres + Auth bundled)

These give you Postgres, authentication, and APIs in one package. Ideal if you want **RLS (Row Level Security) to work out of the box**.

### ðŸ”¹ [Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth)

![Supabase Auth](/content/blog/top-open-source-postgres-auth-solution/supabase-auth.webp)

- **Features:** Email/password, magic links, OAuth, phone, Web3 logins.
- **Integration:** Deep RLS support (`auth.uid()`, `auth.jwt()` directly usable in policies).
- **Third-party support:** Can trust IdPs like Clerk, Firebase Auth, Cognito, WorkOS, etc. but only if they issue **asymmetric JWTs**. Key rotation can lag \~30 min. Supabase Auth itself canâ€™t be disabled.
- **Best for:** Startups and teams that want the **fastest path** to secure Postgres apps.

### ðŸ”¹ [Nhost](https://nhost.io/product/auth) (Hasura-based)

![Nhost](/content/blog/top-open-source-postgres-auth-solution/nhost-auth.webp)

- **Features:** Postgres + Hasura GraphQL API + Auth.
- **Integration:** Auth ties into Hasura permissions, which map back to Postgres RLS.
- **Best for:** Teams building **GraphQL-first apps** who want a fully open-source stack.

## 2. Libraries (you own the server)

These plug into your backend, store users in Postgres, and issue JWTs. You stay in control.

### ðŸ”¹ [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/)

![Auth.js](/content/blog/top-open-source-postgres-auth-solution/authjs.webp)

- **Features:** 50+ OAuth providers, session handling, JWT support.
- **Integration:** Postgres adapter for users and sessions.
- **Best for:** Apps with custom backends, especially **Next.js** or full-stack JS.

### ðŸ”¹ [Better Auth](https://better-auth.com/)

![better-auth](/content/blog/top-open-source-postgres-auth-solution/better-auth.webp)

- **Features:** TypeScript-first, supports multi-tenancy, 2FA, org management.
- **Integration:** Native Postgres support with Kysely/Drizzle + schema migration tooling.
- **Best for:** **TypeScript-heavy teams** who want modern DX and self-hosted control.

### ðŸ”¹ [Lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/) (maintenance mode)

![lucia](/content/blog/top-open-source-postgres-auth-solution/lucia-auth.webp)

- **Features:** Educational focus, lightweight packages.
- **Status:** v3 is deprecated, supported only until March 2025.
- **Best for:** Existing projects. Not recommended for new ones.

## 3. Identity Servers (standalone IdP)

These are separate services that act as the **source of truth for identity**. They issue JWTs for your apps.

### ðŸ”¹ [Ory Kratos](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/)

- **Features:** Registration, recovery, passwordless login, customizable flows.
- **Integration:** Uses Postgres as identity store; issues JWTs consumed by RLS.
- **Best for:** Centralized identity across multiple services.

### ðŸ”¹ [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/)

- **Features:** Enterprise-grade IdP with OIDC, SAML, LDAP, and multi-realm/org support.
- **Integration:** Runs on Postgres and issues JWTs for your apps.
- **Best for:** Large orgs needing **enterprise SSO** and federation features.

### ðŸ”¹ [ZITADEL](https://zitadel.com/)

- **Features:** Modern IdP with org/project/role management.
- **Integration:** Postgres/Cockroach backend; OIDC â†’ Postgres RLS.
- **Best for:** Cloud-native teams who want a modern, OSS alternative to commercial IdPs.

## 4. Other OSS Option

### ðŸ”¹ [SuperTokens](https://supertokens.com/)

- **Features:** Recipes for email/password, social login, passwordless, session management.
- **Integration:** Native Postgres support; cloud or self-host.
- **Best for:** Developers who want **prebuilt flows** but remain OSS-first.

## 5. [Postgres-Native Pattern](/blog/postgres-native-pattern/) (minimalist)

You can also skip heavy auth systems:

- Issue JWTs (from a small service or IdP).
- Validate them at the API edge (PostgREST, Supabase, or a proxy).
- Let **RLS** enforce access inside Postgres.

**Best for:** Small-to-mid apps where you want **maximum simplicity** and DB-driven auth.

## Conclusion

- **Fastest startup path** â†’ **Supabase Auth**
- **GraphQL-first stack** â†’ **Nhost**
- **Custom backend** â†’ **Auth.js** or **Better Auth**
- **Enterprise / multi-app identity** â†’ **Keycloak, Ory Kratos, ZITADEL**
- **Minimalist & DB-driven** â†’ Postgres-native JWT â†’ RLS
- **Prebuilt recipes** â†’ **SuperTokens**

No matter which tool you pick, the principle is the same: **JWT claims flow into Postgres RLS**, making the database itself the final gatekeeper.
