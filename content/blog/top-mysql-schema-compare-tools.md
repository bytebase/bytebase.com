Database schema compare tool enables you to identify differences in the object structure within relational databases, and synchronize your specific objects across multiple databases. It is usually used in the following scenarios:

- Merge database changes from your private branch to your team's main branch
- Maintain schema consistency across homogeneous databases
- Build a new database test environment
- Deploy database schema changes to production based on application requirements
- Troubleshoot database problems when the service is down

## MySQL Workbench

[MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/) is the official GUI for MySQL development from Oracle. It includes schema comparison and synchronization utilities. It enables you to compare and synchronize schema between models, databases and SQL files. These three types can be the destination, source, or both. The following figure shows the source is model and the destination is database.

In addition, MySQL Workbench allows you to create a report showing the differences in catalog between the compared objects, as the next figure shows.

## dbForge Schema Compare for MySQL
