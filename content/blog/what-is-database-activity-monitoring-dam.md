description: Give an overview about Database Activity Monitoring and its difference from Database Monitoring
---

Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) is a security technology that provides real-time tracking, auditing, and analysis of all database activities to detect threats, enforce compliance, and protect sensitive data from unauthorized access or misuse. Originating in the early 2000s and formally recognized by the industry around 2005-2006, DAM has evolved into an essential component of comprehensive database security strategies.

## Difference from Database Monitoring

While DAM is often confused with general database monitoring, the distinction is significant. Database monitoring primarily focuses on **performance metrics**, system health, and operational efficiency—tracking parameters like CPU usage, memory allocation, query performance, and system availability to ensure optimal database functioning.

In contrast, DAM concentrates exclusively on **security aspects**: who is accessing what data, when, and how. DAM captures SQL statements, privileged user activities, schema changes, and data modifications from a security perspective rather than a performance viewpoint. This security-centric approach allows organizations to maintain complete audit trails of all database interactions, detect unusual access patterns, enforce separation of duties, and prevent unauthorized data manipulation—capabilities that traditional performance monitoring tools simply don't address.

## Key Features

- **Complete Visibility:** View all database activities including queries, schema changes, and data access in a single dashboard
- **Unauthorized Access Detection:** Receive immediate alerts when users attempt to access data beyond their authorized scope
- **Compliance Reporting:** Generate ready-made reports for regulatory frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and SOX
- **Privileged User Monitoring:** Track what database administrators and power users are doing with sensitive data
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identify unusual patterns that deviate from normal database usage
- **Policy Enforcement:** Set and enforce data access policies across your organization
- **Audit Trail Creation:** Maintain comprehensive, tamper-proof logs of all database activities
- **Data Classification:** Automatically discover, categorize, and label sensitive data (such as PII, PHI, financial records) to apply appropriate security controls and monitoring intensity
