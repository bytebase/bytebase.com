**DevSecOps** stands for Development, Security, and Operations. It extends the principles of DevOps by embedding security practices throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC), from initial design to deployment and maintenance.

In traditional DevOps, security checks might occur at the end of the development process. DevSecOps shifts this to ["shift-left"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-left_testing) security, meaning security is integrated early and continuously across the pipeline. In this post, we are taking a look at some popular DevSecOps tools.

## GitLab - CI/CD

GitLab began as an open-source alternative to GitHub, initially focusing on version control and collaboration for developers. Over the years, GitLab has evolved into a comprehensive DevSecOps platform, embedding security directly into the software development lifecycle.

In March 2024, GitLab further reinforced its security focus by [acquiring Oxeye](https://about.gitlab.com/press/releases/2024-03-20-gitlab-acquires-oxeye-to-advance-application-security-and-governance-capabilities), a company specializing in cloud-native application security and risk management.

## Snyk - Vulnerability

Snyk is a developer-first security platform that focuses on integrating security into the development workflow, enabling teams to identify and remediate vulnerabilities across the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC). As a key player in the DevSecOps space, Snyk bridges the gap between developers and security teams by embedding automated security checks directly into coding, build, and deployment pipelines.

By providing real-time feedback within IDEs, CI/CD pipelines, and repositories, Snyk's platform empowers developers to take ownership of security without disrupting their workflows.

Snyk also expands its capabilities via acquisitions. In 2024, it has acquired [Probely](https://snyk.io/news/snyk-acquires-developer-first-dast-provider-probely/) and [Helios](https://snyk.io/blog/welcoming-helios-to-snyk/).

## HashiCorp Terraform + Vault - Infrastructure

HashiCorp [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) form a powerful combination in the DevSecOps landscape, embedding security into infrastructure provisioning and secrets management.

Terraform automates the provisioning, modification, and management of infrastructure across cloud providers, data centers, and services through declarative code. It enables consistent and repeatable infrastructure deployment while minimizing human error.

Vault manages secrets and sensitive data through a unified interface, providing dynamic secrets, data encryption, and identity-based access across distributed infrastructure and applications.

When combined, Terraform and Vault create a secure and automated infrastructure pipeline that adheres to DevSecOps principles.

- Terraform provisions cloud resources (e.g., AWS EC2, RDS) and configures services using IaC.
- During provisioning, Terraform fetches secrets from Vault dynamically. This ensures no static credentials are stored in the Terraform code or repositories.
- [Sentinel policies](https://www.hashicorp.com/sentinel) validate infrastructure compliance before deployment, ensuring all resources meet security requirements.
- Vault continues managing secrets post-deployment, dynamically rotating them and preventing unauthorized access.

## Cortex - Service Catalog

[Cortex](https://www.cortex.io/) is an Internal Developer Portal (IDP) designed to enhance visibility, governance, and security across development workflows, aligning development, security, and operations teams to ensure compliance and improve system resilience. Cortex [integrates](https://www.cortex.io/integrations) with aforementioned tools like Sonar, Snyk, embedding security checks within CI/CD pipelines.

## Bytebase - Database

[Bytebase](/) is a [database DevSecOps](/blog/what-is-database-devsecops/) platform designed for developers, security, DBA, and platform engineering teams.

Bytebase enhances database security and compliance through features like SQL Review, fine-grained database permissions, and dynamic data masking.

## Summary

DevSecOps integrates security into every phase of the software development lifecycle. This post explores popular DevSecOps tools, including GitLab for CI/CD security, Snyk for vulnerability scanning, HashiCorp for infrastructure security, Cortex for service governance, and Bytebase for secure database development workflow. These tools reflect the growing emphasis on proactive, continuous security within modern development pipelines.
