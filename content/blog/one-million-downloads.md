On August 1st, 2023, Bytebase reached another milestone to have 1 Million downloads.

It's been more than 2 years since [we announced Bytebase](/blog/announce-bytebase/). As an open source
project, Bytebase has been growing way faster than the classic [Liquibase](/blog/bytebase-vs-liquibase/) and [Flyway](/blog/bytebase-vs-flyway/).

As pioneering the [database-as-code](/blog/database-as-code/) methodology, Bytebase is also among
the fastest growing as-code open source projects.

Over the past two years, our user base has grown to include individuals and organizations from around the globe, ranging from a central bank in South America to an eCommerce platform in the Middle East, a telecom group in Southeast Asia, a payment gateway in Africa, an email provider in Europe, and even a pest control vendor in the United States. It seems that our reach extends even to the remote Fiji Islands!

Today, Bytebase is the only database tool included by both the [CNCF Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/?selected=bytebase) and [Platform Engineering Landscape](https://platformengineering.org/tools/bytebase).

Our goal stays the same as we started the project, to invent a new category to change, query, secure, govern all different databases inside a single platform, and to bring the GitLab/GitHub experience to developer, DBA and the platform engineering
teams.

Way to go!
