## From DevOps to Platform Engineering

**DevOps** emerged around 2009 as a cultural and professional movement focused on breaking down silos between development and operations teams. It emphasized collaboration, automation, and shared responsibility for the entire software lifecycle.

**Platform Engineering**, on the other hand, emerged more recently as organizations realized that while DevOps principles were valuable, their implementation often led to cognitive overload for developers. Instead of expecting every developer to become an expert in infrastructure, monitoring, and operations, platform engineering focuses on creating internal developer platforms (IDPs) that abstract away complexity.

The evolution looked something like this:

- Traditional IT: Separate dev and ops teams with conflicting goals
- DevOps: Integrated teams sharing responsibilities and tools
- Platform Engineering: Specialized teams building self-service platforms that empower developers

The key distinction is that DevOps engineers primarily focus on enabling automation and collaboration, while platform engineers focus on building products for internal developer consumption.

## Months 1-2: Technical Basics

</HintBlock>

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Learn declarative tools like [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). Start with small projects, gradually building to complex, modular infrastructure definitions. Practice state management and version control for infrastructure.

_Further Reading: [Terraform Best Practices](https://www.terraform-best-practices.com/)_

### Containerization

Move beyond basic Docker to understand image optimization, [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/), and security scanning. Create standardized Dockerfiles and container patterns for different application types.

### Networking

Learn concepts like service mesh implementations, ingress control, and network policies. Learn how to design secure, scalable networking for containerized applications.

### Orchestration

Dive into Kubernetes fundamentals and architecture. Set up a cluster, deploy applications, and understand the control plane. Explore Kubernetes custom resources and operators.

_Further Reading: [Kubernetes Learning Path](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/)_

### Cloud Platforms

Develop working knowledge of at least one major cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP). Learn core services for compute, networking, storage, and identity. Practice building environments using both console and IaC.

### Developer Empathy

Shadow application developers to understand their workflows and pain points. Identify repetitive tasks that could be automated or simplified.

## Month 3-4: Real-world Practice

### CI/CD Pipelines

Build automated delivery pipelines that support the entire software lifecycle. Create standardized templates that enforce quality gates while remaining customizable.

### Observability

Implement observability solutions using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK stack. Design dashboards that provide actionable insights for both platform and application teams.

_Further Reading: [Observability Glossary](https://www.honeycomb.io/getting-started/observability-glossary)_

### Security

Embed security throughout the platform with robust authentication, RBAC, and automated vulnerability scanning. Learn to implement security as code using tools like [OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/).

_Further Reading: [Vault by HashiCorp](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials), [Container Security by Snyk](https://snyk.io/learn/container-security/)_

### Technical Documentation

Practice writing clear, accessible documentation for the systems you build. Focus on both "how-to" guides and architectural decision records.

_Further Reading: [Google's Technical Writing Courses](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing), [The Documentation System](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/)_

## Month 5-6: Platform Thinking

### API Design

Practice designing APIs that are easy to understand, self-documenting, and follow consistent patterns.

_Further Reading: [Google API Improvement Proposal](https://google.aip.dev/1)_

### Service Architecture

Study modern service patterns and communication models. Understand how to design maintainable microservices with clear boundaries and contracts. Practice designing resilient, scalable systems. Learn to evaluate tradeoffs between different architectural approaches and document your decisions.

_Further Reading: [AWS Architecture Center](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/)_

### Cross-team Collaboration

Actively engage with security, operations, and development teams to understand their requirements and constraints. Practice being a technical translator between groups.

## Ongoing

### Abstraction Design

Work on creating the right level of abstraction for developer interfaces. Practice hiding complexity while providing necessary control points.

### Self-service & Golden Paths

Build self-service capabilities that empower teams while ensuring compliance. Design opinionated workflows that make the right way the easy way.

_Further Reading: [Backstage](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/what-is-backstage/)_

### Metrics and Measurement

Establish metrics that demonstrate platform value, from reliability indicators to developer productivity measurements. Use data to identify which capabilities deliver the most impact.

_Further Reading: [DORA Metrics Explained](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/using-the-four-keys-to-measure-your-devops-performance)_

### Cost Optimization

Implement cloud spending controls through tagging strategies, right-sizing resources, and spot instance usage. Create transparency around resource consumption and help teams understand their cost impact.

_Further Reading: [AWS Cost Optimization Pillar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/cost-optimization-pillar/welcome.html), [Kubernetes Cost Optimization](https://www.kubecost.com/kubernetes-cost-optimization/)_

### Technical Roadmapping

Create a vision for platform evolution that balances immediate needs with long-term objectives. Learn to prioritize features based on impact and communicate the roadmap to stakeholders.

## AI and Continuous Learning

The platform engineering space is evolving at breakneck speed, particularly as AI reshapes how we build and operate systems. What looks cutting-edge today may be table stakes tomorrow. AI-powered infrastructure management, intelligent observability, and generative code platforms are already transforming how platform teams operate. Today's platform engineers must embrace a mindset of continuous learningâ€”not just completing this 6-month roadmap and stopping, but establishing habits that keep you at the forefront of the field.
