When comparing **Supabase** and **AWS**, the key question isn't just about raw features, it's about how much functionality you get **per dollar** and how easily you can scale from a free plan to enterprise-grade infrastructure.

In this guide, we break down the pricing and functionality for each of **Supabase‚Äôs core features** and compare them to their **closest AWS counterparts**:

- Supabase Database ‚Üí AWS RDS PostgreSQL
- Supabase Auth ‚Üí AWS Cognito
- Supabase Storage ‚Üí AWS S3
- Supabase Edge Functions ‚Üí AWS Lambda
- Supabase Realtime (Messages) ‚Üí AWS SQS/SNS

We‚Äôll go **feature by feature**, then compare **total costs at different usage tiers**, and conclude with final recommendations.

## Feature by Feature

### üóÑÔ∏è Database: Supabase DB vs AWS RDS

**Supabase:** Built-in PostgreSQL with real-time, REST API, and simple pricing.

**AWS RDS:** Fully managed PostgreSQL with high configurability, performance tuning, and multi-AZ support.

üß¨ Supabase is easier and more predictable. RDS gives more control and is better for compliance-heavy or complex workloads.

See our full comparison here: [Supabase vs AWS Database Pricing (2025)](/blog/supabase-vs-aws-database-pricing/)

- Supabase bundles compute, storage, backup, and bandwidth into flat tiers.
- AWS RDS offers cheaper options if you commit to Reserved Instances, but requires piecing together compute, storage, backup, and bandwidth costs.

‚û°Ô∏è If you want predictable cost and fast setup, choose Supabase. If you need performance tuning or compliance, go with RDS.

### üîê Auth: Supabase Auth vs AWS Cognito

**Supabase:** Easy-to-use auth system with social login, magic links, phone support, and DB integration.

**AWS Cognito:** Feature-rich identity management with SSO, federation, and enterprise IAM support.

üß¨ **Supabase Auth is simpler and developer-friendly**, great for fast setup and apps with straightforward auth needs. **Cognito is better for enterprises** that require SSO, security compliance, and deep AWS integration.

| Feature         | Supabase Auth          | AWS Cognito              |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Free Tier       | 50,000 MAUs            | 50,000 MAUs              |
| Paid Pricing    | \$0.0015/MAU | \$0.0055/MAU             |
| SSO Support     | Enterprise plan only   | Included (OIDC, SAML)    |
| MFA / Passwords | Included               | Included                 |
| Rate Limits     | Generous               | Strict (especially SAML) |

‚û°Ô∏è **Choose Supabase if you want fast, simple auth for apps. Choose Cognito if SSO and federation matter.**

### üì¶ Storage: Supabase Storage vs AWS S3

**Supabase:** App-friendly storage with built-in access control, REST API, and CDN.

**AWS S3:** Scalable object store with advanced features and global durability.

üß¨ Supabase is easier to use for app developers. S3 is more powerful and flexible for enterprise-scale needs.

| Feature      | Supabase Storage     | AWS S3                |
| ------------ | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Free Tier    | 1GB                  | 5GB (12 months only)  |
| Paid Pricing | \$0.021/GB           | \$0.023/GB (Standard) |
| API          | Simple REST          | REST/S3 SDKs          |
| Permissions  | Built-in (row-level) | IAM Policies          |
| CDN          | Included             | Optional (CloudFront) |

‚û°Ô∏è **Use Supabase for media, uploads, and frontend-friendly usage. Use S3 for scalable, secure, production storage.**

### ‚öôÔ∏è Edge Functions: Supabase vs AWS Lambda

**Supabase:** Deno-based edge functions with tight database integration and minimal cold starts.

**AWS Lambda:** Flexible, multi-runtime functions with deep AWS service integration.

üß¨ Supabase is simpler for edge APIs. Lambda is better for complex logic, language flexibility, and AWS ecosystem workflows.

| Feature        | Supabase Edge Functions | AWS Lambda            |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| Free Tier      | 500,000 invocations     | 1 million/month       |
| Runtime        | Deno                    | Node.js, Python, etc. |
| Cold Starts    | Minimal                 | Varies by region      |
| Region         | Global edge             | Region-based          |
| Pricing (Paid) | \$2/million calls       | \$0.20/million + GB-s |

‚û°Ô∏è **Pick Supabase for fast global APIs. Use Lambda for language flexibility and deep AWS integrations.**

### üì° Realtime: Supabase Messages vs AWS SQS/SNS

**Supabase:** WebSocket-based realtime updates from DB triggers for simple pub/sub.

**AWS SQS/SNS:** Robust messaging services for queueing and event-driven systems.

üß¨ Supabase is great for simple real-time features. AWS is better for event-driven architecture and high-scale messaging.

| Feature     | Supabase Realtime   | AWS SQS / SNS        |
| ----------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Free Tier   | 500,000 messages    | 1M requests/month    |
| Pub/Sub     | Built-in            | SNS only             |
| Queue       | Limited queue model | SQS (queueing)       |
| Integration | PostgreSQL triggers | Broad (Lambda, etc.) |
| Pricing     | Simple flat overage | Per-request pricing  |

‚û°Ô∏è **Use Supabase if you need simple pub/sub from your DB. Choose AWS for large-scale event systems.**

## üí∞ Pricing Comparison by Tier

### üí° About AWS Reserved Pricing
 The AWS prices shown below are based on **on-demand usage**, which is flexible but more expensive.
 If you commit to **1-year or 3-year Reserved Instances** (RIs), you can cut costs by **30‚Äì70%** ‚Äî especially for RDS and Lambda.

 For example:

 - **RDS db.m5.large (Multi-AZ)** drops from **\$250+/mo** to **\~\$145/mo** (1-year RI, no upfront)
 - **Lambda and compute** costs can be reduced via **Compute Savings Plans**

 ‚úÖ Use on-demand for flexibility.
 üîê Use Reserved pricing for long-term, cost-optimized workloads ‚Äî but it comes with lock-in.

### üß™ 0. Free Tier
