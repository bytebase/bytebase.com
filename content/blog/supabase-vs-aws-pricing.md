---

When comparing **Supabase** and **AWS**, the key question isn't just about raw features, it's about how much functionality you get **per dollar** and how easily you can scale from a free plan to enterprise-grade infrastructure.

In this guide, we break down the pricing and functionality for each of **Supabase‚Äôs core features** and compare them to their **closest AWS counterparts**:

- Supabase Database ‚Üí AWS RDS PostgreSQL
- Supabase Auth ‚Üí AWS Cognito
- Supabase Storage ‚Üí AWS S3
- Supabase Edge Functions ‚Üí AWS Lambda
- Supabase Realtime (Messages) ‚Üí AWS SQS/SNS

We‚Äôll go **feature by feature**, then compare **total costs at different usage tiers**, and conclude with final recommendations.

---

## Feature by Feature

### üóÑÔ∏è Database: Supabase DB vs AWS RDS

**Supabase:** Built-in PostgreSQL with real-time, REST API, and simple pricing.

**AWS RDS/Aurora:** Fully managed PostgreSQL with high configurability, performance tuning, and multi-AZ support.

üß¨ Supabase is easier and more predictable. RDS gives more control and is better for compliance-heavy or complex workloads.

See our full comparison here: [Supabase vs AWS Database Pricing (2025)](/blog/supabase-vs-aws-database-pricing/)

- Supabase bundles compute, storage, backup, and bandwidth into flat tiers.
- AWS RDS offers cheaper options if you commit to Reserved Instances, but requires piecing together compute, storage, backup, and bandwidth costs.

‚û°Ô∏è If you want more predictable cost and fast setup, choose Supabase. If you need performance tuning or compliance, go with RDS.

### üîê Auth: Supabase Auth vs AWS Cognito

**Supabase:** Easy-to-use auth system with social login, magic links, phone support, and DB integration.

**AWS Cognito:** Feature-rich identity management with SSO, federation, and enterprise IAM support.

üß¨ **Supabase Auth is simpler and developer-friendly**, great for fast setup and apps with straightforward auth needs. **Cognito is better for enterprises** that require SSO, security compliance, and deep AWS integration.

| Feature         | Supabase Auth        | AWS Cognito              |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Free Tier       | 50,000 MAUs          | 50,000 MAUs              |
| Paid Pricing    | \$0.0015/MAU         | \$0.0055/MAU             |
| SSO Support     | Enterprise plan only | Included (OIDC, SAML)    |
| MFA / Passwords | Included             | Included                 |
| Rate Limits     | Generous             | Strict (especially SAML) |

‚û°Ô∏è Choose Supabase if you want fast, simple auth for your apps. However, as your business grows, your team will likely need a more sophisticated auth solution. Cognito is one option, but many teams also consider Okta, Azure Entra, or WorkOS.

### üì¶ Storage: Supabase Storage vs AWS S3

**Supabase:** S3-compatible storage with built-in access control, REST API, and CDN.

**AWS S3:** Scalable object store with advanced features and global durability.

üß¨ Supabase is easier to use for app developers. S3 is more powerful and flexible for enterprise-scale needs.

| Feature      | Supabase Storage     | AWS S3                |
| ------------ | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Free Tier    | 1GB                  | 5GB (12 months only)  |
| Paid Pricing | \$0.021/GB           | \$0.023/GB (Standard) |
| API          | Simple REST          | REST/S3 SDKs          |
| Permissions  | Built-in (row-level) | IAM Policies          |
| CDN          | Included             | Optional (CloudFront) |

‚û°Ô∏è It seems that Supabase Storage is built on top of AWS S3, providing an easy-to-use interface and lower pricing‚Äîlikely due to volume discounts they can secure. The tradeoff is reduced flexibility in managing the underlying S3 buckets directly.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Edge Functions: Supabase vs AWS Lambda

**Supabase:** Deno-based edge functions with tight database integration and minimal cold starts.

**AWS Lambda:** Flexible, multi-runtime functions with deep AWS service integration.

üß¨ Supabase is simpler for edge APIs. Lambda is better for complex logic, language flexibility, and AWS ecosystem workflows.


| Feature          | Supabase Edge Functions                | AWS Lambda                             |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Free Tier**    | 500,000 invocations                    | 1 million requests/month               |
| **Runtime**      | Deno                                   | Node.js, Python, etc.                  |
| **Cold Starts**  | Minimal                                | Varies by region                       |
| **Region**       | Global edge                            | Region-based                           |
| **Request Cost** | **\$2 per million** (includes compute) | **\$0.20 per million** (requests only) |
| **Compute Cost** | Included in flat price                 | **Additional**: \$0.00001667 per GB-s  |

- **Supabase** charges a flat fee per call ‚Äî **simpler but may appear higher** at first glance.
- **AWS Lambda** splits billing into two parts:
  - **Requests** (cheap)
  - **Compute** (based on memory x execution time), which can add up.

‚û°Ô∏è Supabase Edge charges only an invocation fee, while AWS Lambda has separate charges for invocations and compute time, measured in GB-seconds. Additionally, AWS Lambda supports a wider range of runtimes.

### üì° Realtime: Supabase Messages vs AWS SQS/SNS

**Supabase:** WebSocket-based realtime updates triggered by PostgreSQL changes. Great for simple in-app messaging and live UIs.

**AWS SQS/SNS:** Scalable, fully managed messaging services. Ideal for decoupled, event-driven architectures and backend pipelines.

üß¨ Supabase is great for realtime UX. AWS is better for complex, distributed systems.

| Feature         | Supabase Realtime                   | AWS SQS / SNS                                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Free Tier**   | 500,000 messages/month              | 1 million requests/month                                                |
| **Pub/Sub**     | Built-in                            | SNS only                                                                |
| **Queueing**    | Limited                             | SQS provides advanced queueing                                          |
| **Integration** | PostgreSQL triggers                 | Broad: Lambda, S3, EC2, etc.                                            |
| **Pricing**     | **\$2 per million messages** (flat) | **\$0.40‚Äì\$0.50 per million requests** + delivery & data transfer costs |

- **Supabase** charges a flat fee per message, making pricing simple and predictable.
- **AWS SQS/SNS** charges separately for requests, message delivery, and data transfer, offering greater flexibility and scalability for complex event-driven systems.
  - **SQS Standard**: \~\$0.40 per million requests
  - **SNS**: \~\$0.50 per million publishes
  - Additional charges: Message delivery (e.g., to Lambda, HTTP endpoints, or SQS) and **Data transfer** if messages cross regions

‚û°Ô∏è **Supabase Realtime charges a flat fee per message**, making pricing simple and predictable. **AWS SQS/SNS charges separately for requests, message delivery, and data transfer**, offering greater flexibility and scalability for complex event-driven systems.

## üí∞ Pricing Comparison by Tier

### üí° About AWS Reserved Pricing

The AWS prices shown below are based on **on-demand usage**, which is flexible but more expensive.
If you commit to **1-year or 3-year Reserved Instances** (RIs), you can cut costs by **30‚Äì70%** ‚Äî especially for RDS and Lambda.

For example:

- **RDS db.m5.large (Multi-AZ)** drops from **\$250+/mo** to **\~\$145/mo** (1-year RI, no upfront)
- **Lambda and compute** costs can be reduced via **Compute Savings Plans**

‚úÖ Use on-demand for flexibility.
üîê Use Reserved pricing for long-term, cost-optimized workloads ‚Äî but it comes with lock-in.

### üß† 4. Hyperscale (10M MAUs, 10TB DB, 200TB Storage, 500TB Bandwidth)

At this scale, you're operating at a level that most platforms ‚Äî including Supabase ‚Äî aren't built to serve out of the box.

#### Supabase ‚Äì ‚ùå Not Recommended at This Scale

Supabase‚Äôs architecture is optimized for small to mid-sized applications. While enterprise plans exist, the platform:

- Does not offer **horizontal scalability** for PostgreSQL (no native sharding or clustering).
- Becomes **cost-prohibitive** with 10M+ MAUs due to flat per-user pricing.
- Lacks fine-grained controls over **networking, observability, and infrastructure**.
- May require **custom support contracts** and offloading core services (e.g., auth to WorkOS, storage to S3) to be viable.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Supabase is a great tool for rapid product development, but **most teams at this scale migrate to cloud-native stacks** like AWS, GCP, or Azure for performance, reliability, and cost control.

‚úÖ If you're approaching hyperscale, you can still **start with Supabase** ‚Äî but architect with portability in mind.

## üß† Final Thoughts

**Supabase is a fantastic platform for startups and growing teams** ‚Äî offering a unified experience, generous free tier, and simple pricing across auth, database, storage, edge functions, and realtime.

It‚Äôs ideal for:

- Prototypes and MVPs
- Small-to-mid-scale production apps
- Teams that want to move fast without managing infrastructure

But as your product reaches **hyperscale ‚Äî millions of users, terabytes of data, and high-throughput compute** ‚Äî **Supabase starts to hit architectural and economic limits**:

- PostgreSQL isn‚Äôt horizontally scalable in their setup
- Auth and bandwidth costs grow steeply
- Fine-grained performance tuning and compliance become difficult

### üõ£Ô∏è Scale Path

‚û°Ô∏è Many teams **start with Supabase** to move quickly, then gradually **offload services** (auth, compute, storage) to cloud-native infrastructure like **AWS, GCP, or Azure** as scale and complexity grow.

‚úÖ **Choose Supabase** if you want a fast, simple way to build and scale to your first million users.
‚úÖ **Choose AWS** if you need performance at scale, deep customization, or global enterprise-grade infrastructure.
