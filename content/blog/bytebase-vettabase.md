Bytebase has partnered with [Vettabase](https://vettabase.com/)!

Bytebase is pleased to announce a partnership with Vettabase, an open source database services company with a focus on database automation founded in July 2020. Vettabase expertise helps the company serve complex MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Cassandra setups while tackling other related technologies and tools.

Bytebase is an open source database DevOps tool, the GitLab for managing databases throughout the application development lifecycle. Bytebase offers a web-based workspace for DBAs and software developers to collaborate and manage schema changes safely and efficiently.

Vettabase services are a perfect fit for Bytebase customers and users.

Database Health Checks to identify problems that can reduce your database performance or reliability. This includes poor schema design, slow queries, but also non-optimal database configuration, non-optimal system configuration, or inadequate virtual or physical resources.

Training for software developers. While Bytebase remains important to version and validate schema changes, it is equally important that software developers understand query optimization and the good practices of schema design. For most applications, this will eliminate performance problems and increase application maintainability.

Training for data analysts is designed to make analysts more productive by teaching them very advanced SQL features (such as window functions and CTEs). They will also learn query optimization techniques to obtain results within a reasonable time as some analytics queries can even take days.

Monthly DBA Time service, you can use a package of monthly hours to ask our experts to solve performance problems, run critical tasks, or make sure that your databases are in good health.

If you have any questions related to our partnership with Vettabase or our services, contact us, and we'll come up with a solution that fits your needs.
