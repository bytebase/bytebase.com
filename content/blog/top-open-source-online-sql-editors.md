## What are the criteria?

1. **Open source**.
1. **Web-based**. Can be accessed via browser.
1. **Can be self-hosted**. Tools that don't offer a self-hosted version are not included.
1. **General-purpose**. Not specialized in a specific database type.
1. **Actively maintained**. Judged subjectively based on the project activities.

We pick SQL Editor, DbGate, CloudBeaver, Metabase, and Redash as the top 5 open source, online SQL Editors. They are categorized into 2 groups:

1. SQL Editor, DbGate, CloudBeaver are relative new and more focused on the SQL query and editing experience.
1. Metabase and Redash are more established and focused on the data visualization and dashboarding.

## SQL Editor

![sql-editor](/content/blog/top-open-source-online-sql-editors/sql-editor.webp)

[SQL Editor](https://www.sql-editor.com) is a web-based SQL client built by Bytebase. It can run in 2 modes:

    1. Stand-alone.
    1. Embedded within other platform (white-label).

Unlike traditional SQL clients, SQL Editor enforces security and compliance by integrating access control, data masking, and audit logging into the SQL execution process.

**Who is SQL Editor for?**

SQL Editor is designed for developers, DBAs, and security teams who need a governed SQL execution environment. It’s ideal for teams in regulated industries or
those following database access control and audit best practices.

## Repository activity

GitHub star wise, all projects have gained decent tractions.

![star-history](/content/blog/top-open-source-online-sql-editors/star-history.webp)

Other than the GitHub star vanity metric, let's look at the monthly repository activities between Jan 24, 2025 and Feb 24, 2025.

| Products    | Merged PRs | Opened PRs | Closed Issues | New Issues |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| SQL Editor  | 217        | 0          | 4             | 10         |
| DbGate      | 4          | 3          | 18            | 25         |
| CloudBeaver | 63         | 7          | 6             | 6          |
| Metabase    | 1008       | 137        | 365           | 171        |
| Redash      | 9          | 15         | 2             | 9          |

The stats could be misleading:

- `Merged PRs` could be very high if the project maintains many active release branches and need to cherrypick. This is the case for Metabase.
- `Opened PRs` only count the PRs that are opened in the same repo. For a public repo, it's quite possible that the PR is opened in a forked repo.
- If the team does not use GitHub Issues to manage the repository, then the `Closed Issues` and `New Issues` are not a good indicator of the project activity.

Overall, SQL Editor, CloudBeaver, and Metabase projects are more active than DbGate and Redash.
