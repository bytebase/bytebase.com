In the last article [Database CI/CD and Schema Migration with ClickHouse](/docs/tutorials/database-change-management-with-clickhouse), you have tried UI workflow in Bytebase.

This tutorial will bring you to the next level by introducing the GitOps workflow, where you commit the schema change script to the GitHub repository, which will in turn trigger the schema deployment pipeline in Bytebase.

You can use Bytebase's **Community Plan** to finish the tutorial.

## Features included

- GitOps Workflow
- Change History

## Prerequisites

Before you start this tutorial, make sure:

- You have followed our previous UI-based change tutorial [Database CI/CD and Schema Migration with ClickHouse](/docs/tutorials/database-change-management-with-clickhouse).
- You have a [ClickHouse Cloud](https://clickhouse.cloud/) account or a ClickHouse self-managed instance running.
- You have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
- You have a public GitHub repository, e.g. `test-bb-gitops`.
- You have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed locally.
- You have a [ngrok](http://ngrok.com) account.

## Step 1 - Run Bytebase in Docker and set the External URL generated by ngrok

## Step 2 - Find your ClickHouse instance in Bytebase

1. Visit Bytebase Console through the browser via your ngrok URL. Log in using your account created from the previous tutorial.

1. Create one or two new databases on your Spanner instances for different environments, refer to [previous tutorial](/docs/tutorials/database-change-management-with-clickhouse) if you need help.

## Step 5 - Change schema for ClickHouse by pushing SQL schema change files to GitHub

1. In your GitHub repository `test-bb-gitops`, create a folder `bytebase`, then create an sql file `202405111730_create_t1.sql`.

   Paste the sql script in it.

   ```text
   CREATE TABLE
      t1 (id UInt64) ENGINE = MergeTree
      ORDER BY id;
   ```

1. Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. Click **Merge pull request** to merge the new branch into the main branch.

1. There will be a comment saying there's a rollout in Bytebase. Click the link to the issue page, youâ€™ll see

   1. The issue is created via GitHub.com, there's a link to the GitHub commit.
   1. The SQL is exactly the one we have committed to the GitHub repository.
   1. The SQL has passed the automatic task checks and rollout automatically.
   1. Since there're two databases in the project, Bytebase creates a 2-staged pipeline to roll out the change sequentially.
