## The Database CI/CD Workflow

<IncludeBlock url="/docs/share/tutorials/database-workflow"></IncludeBlock>

## Set Up Database CI/CD with Bitbucket in Bytebase (Free Plan)

Here's a step-by-step tutorial on how to set up this Database CI/CD with Bitbucket in Bytebase.

## Step 1 - Run Bytebase in Docker and set the External URL generated by ngrok

<IncludeBlock url="/docs/get-started/install/vcs-with-ngrok"></IncludeBlock>

## Step 2 - Add Bitbucket.org as a Git provider in Bytebase

1. Visit Bytebase via your ngrok URL. Click **CI/CD** > **GitOps**, choose `Bitbucket.org`.

   ![bb-gitops-bitb](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-bitbucket/bb-gitops-bitb.webp)

1. Follow the **app password** link to [https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/](https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/) and click **Create app password**. Fill in the Label, then check the following fields and click **Create**.

   - Account (Read)
   - Workspace membership (Read)
   - Projects (Read)
   - Webhooks (Read and Write)
   - Repositories (Read and Write)
   - Pull requests (Read and Write)

   ![bitb-app-pwd](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-bitbucket/bitb-app-pwd.webp)

1. Copy the generated password, go back to Bytebase, and paste the password into the field with your bitbucket username and click **Confirm and add**. The provider is added successfully.

## Step 3 - Configure a GitOps Workflow in Bytebase

1. Go to `bitbucket.org`, under workspace `bytebase-demo`, create a new project `bb-gitops-2024` and a repository `bb-test`.

1. Go to Bytebase, go to the `Sample Project`. Click **Integration >GitOps** on the left and click **Add GitOps connector**. Choose `Bitbucket.org 2024` (the git provider you just configured) and `bytebase-demo/bb-test` (the repository you just created).

1. Keep the default settings for the remaining fields and click **Finish**. The gitops connector is created successfully.

## Step 4 - Configure SQL Review in Prod

1. Go to **CI/CD > SQL Review** in workspace, choose `Prod` as the environment. Make sure a SQL review policy is attached and enabled on `Prod`.

   ![bb-sql-review](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-bitbucket/bb-sql-review.webp)

1. Click **Edit**, click **PostgreSQL** tab. Make sure `Enforce "NOT NULL" constraints on columns` is enabled. This is to make sure the SQL Review can work.

## Step 5 - Create a Pull Request to trigger issue creation

1. Go to `bb-test` on Bitbucket. Add a new file `20240919_create_table_t2024.sql` under `bb-test/bytebase/` which is the directory configured in the previous step. Copy the following SQL script into the file and commit the change **via a new branch** which will create a Pull Request automatically.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE "public"."t2024" (
         "id" integer PRIMARY KEY,
         "name" text
   );
   ```

1. Wait for a while, there is a SQL Review comment added. As we configured in the previous step, `NOT NULL` is a warning level SQL Review rule.

   ![bitb-sql-review-warning](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-bitbucket/bitb-sql-review-warning.webp)

1. Edit our sql file as following and commit it on the same branch, and merge the PR.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE "public"."t2024" (
         "id" integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
         "name" text NOT NULL
   );
   ```

1. There will be a new comment saying the PR has triggered a Bytebase rollout.

   ![bitb-merged](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-bitbucket/bitb-merged.webp)

1. Follow the link to go to Bytebase. There's an issue with two stages, this is because we have two databases in this project, by default, the SQL will be applied to all databases within the project. If you merge the previous version SQL script, the SQL Review task run here will show yellow warning and waiting for rollout. Click **Resolve** to resolve the issue.

   ![bb-issue-rollout](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-bitbucket/bb-issue-rollout.webp)

1. After the rollout completes, click **View change** to see the diff.

   ![bb-view-change-diff](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-bitbucket/bb-view-change-diff.webp)

1. You may also go to a specific database page to view all its change history.
