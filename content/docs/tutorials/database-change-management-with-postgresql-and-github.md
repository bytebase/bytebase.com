In the last article [Database CI/CD and Schema Migration with PostgreSQL](/docs/tutorials/database-change-management-with-postgresql), you have tried UI workflow in Bytebase.

This tutorial will bring you to the next level by introducing the GitOps workflow, where you commit the schema change script to the GitHub repository via Pull Request, which will in turn trigger the schema deployment pipeline in Bytebase.

You can use Bytebase's **Community Plan** to finish the tutorial.

## Prerequisites

Before you start this tutorial, make sure:

- You have followed our previous UI-based change tutorial [Database CI/CD and Schema Migration with PostgreSQL](/docs/tutorials/database-change-management-with-postgresql).
- You have a GitHub account and a public GitHub repository, e.g. `test-bb-gitops`.
- You have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed locally.
- You have an [ngrok](http://ngrok.com) account.

## Step 1 - Run Bytebase in Docker and set the External URL generated by ngrok

## Step 2 - Find your PostgreSQL databases in Bytebase

1. Visit Bytebase Console through the browser via your ngrok URL. Log in using your admin account.

1. Click **Select Project** on the top bar, and choose the existing `Sample Project`. You will see there're two databases `hr_prod` and `hr_test` in it.
