[Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner) is a distributed SQL database management and storage service developed by Google. It provides features such as global transactions, strongly consistent reads, and automatic multi-site replication and failover.

This tutorial is a step-by-step guide to set up Database Change Management for Spanner in [Bytebase](https://bytebase.com). With Bytebase, a team can have a formalized review and rollout process to make Spanner database schema change and data change.

Bytebase provides a GUI for teams to **perform database changes** and **retain full change history**. You can use Bytebase free version to finish the tutorial.

At the end, there is a bonus section about **Schema Drift Detection** for those advanced users.

## Features included

- Change Workflow
- SQL Editor
- Change History
- Drift Detection

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- An Spanner instance.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

## Step 1 - Deploy Bytebase via Docker

1. Make sure your Docker is running, and start the Bytebase Docker container with following command:

   <IncludeBlock url="/docs/get-started/install/terminal-docker-run-volume"></IncludeBlock>

1. Bytebase is now running via Docker, and you can access it via `localhost:8080`.
   ![docker](/content/docs/tutorials/database-change-management-with-spanner/docker.webp)

1. Visit `localhost:8080` in your browser. Register the first admin account which will be granted [`Workspace Admin`](/docs/concepts/roles-and-permissions).
   ![bb-register](/content/docs/tutorials/database-change-management-with-spanner/bb-register.webp)

## Step 2 - Add an Spanner Instance to Bytebase

In Bytebase, ​​an Instance could be your on-premises MySQL instance, an AWS RDS instance etc, in this tutorial, ​an **Instance** is your `Spanner instance`.

1. Visit `localhost:8080` and log in as `Workspace Admin`.
   ![bb-login](/content/docs/tutorials/database-change-management-with-spanner/bb-login.webp)

2. On the home page, click **Add Instance**.

3. Choose `Spanner`, fill in the fields and click **Create**. Pay attention to these fields:

- **Instance Name**: `Test Spanner Instance`.
- **Environment**: choose `Test`, if you choose `Prod`, you'll need manual approval for all future change requests by default, let's keep it simple for this tutorial.
- **Project ID** and **Instance ID**: [How to Find Project ID and Instance ID](/docs/how-to/spanner/how-to-find-project-id-and-instance-id/)
- **Credentials**: [How to Create a Service Account for Bytebase
  ](/docs/how-to/spanner/how-to-create-a-service-account-for-bytebase/)
  ![bb-create-instance-spanner](/content/docs/tutorials/database-change-management-with-spanner/bb-create-instance-spanner.webp)

## Step 3 - Create a Project

In Bytebase, **Project** groups logically-related **Databases, Issues** and **Users** together, which is similar to the project concept in other DevTools such as Jira and GitLab. So before you deal with the database, a Project must be created.

1. Click **Projects** on the top navigation bar.

2. Click **New Project** to create a new project `Demo UI`, key is `demoui`, mode is `standard`. Click **Create**.

## Step 4 - Create an Spanner Database via Bytebase

In Bytebase, a **Database** is created by `CREATE DATABASE xxx`. A database always belongs to a single **Project**. An **Issue** represents a specific collaboration activity between Developer and DBA for when creating a database, altering a schema. It's similar to the issue concept in other issue management tools.

1. Click **Projects** > `Demo UI` on the left sidebar. Click **New DB** to create a new database. You can click **Transfer in DB** to transfer in your existing databases.
2. Fill the form with **Name** - `test_db`, **Environment** - `Test`, and **Instance** - `Test Spanner Instance`. Click **Create**.
3. Bytebase will create an issue to create the database automatically. As it's the `Test` environment, the issue will run without waiting for your approval by default and then become `Done`.
   ![bb-issue-new-db-test_db-done](/content/docs/tutorials/database-change-management-with-spanner/bb-issue-new-db-test_db-done.webp)

## Step 5 - Create a Table in Spanner via Bytebase

In Step 4, you created an issue to create a database using UI workflow and then executed it. Let’s continue to create a table.

1. Go to the project, and click on **Alter Schema**.

2. Choose `test_db` and click **Next**.

3. Input the SQL as following and click **Create**.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE t1(
      Id INT64 NOT NULL
   ) PRIMARY KEY(Id);
   ```
4. The issue is automatically approved by default since it’s for the `Test` environment. The issue will become `Done` after execution.
   ![bb-issue-alter-schema-t1-done](/content/docs/tutorials/database-change-management-with-spanner/bb-issue-alter-schema-t1-done.webp)

5. From the issue page, click **View change**, and you can see schema diff.
   ![bb-issue-alter-schema-t1-diff](/content/docs/tutorials/database-change-management-with-spanner/bb-issue-alter-schema-t1-diff.webp)

## Step 6 - Add Some Data and Query via SQL Editor

1. Repeat Step 5 to alter schema again, but this time input this SQL:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE t1 ADD COLUMN Name STRING(255);
   ```
2. Go to the project, and click **Change Data**.
3. Choose `test_db` and click **Next**.
4. Fill in the SQL as follows and then click **Create**.

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1, 'Adela');
   ```

5. Wait for its execution and then the issue will become `Done`.
6. Click **SQL Editor** on the left side bar. Input the query and click **Run**. You can see the new row is there.
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM t1;
   ```

## Bonus Section - Schema Drift Detection

To follow this section, you need to activate the **Enterprise Plan** (you can start a 14-day trial directly, no credit card required).

Now you can see the full change history of database `test_db`. However, what is **Establish new baseline**? When to use it?

By adopting Bytebase, we expect teams to use Bytebase exclusively for all schema changes. Meanwhile, if someone has made Spanner schema change out side of Bytebase, obviously Bytebase won’t know it. And because Bytebase has recorded its own copy of schema, when Bytebase compares that with the live schema having that out-of-band schema change, it will notice a discrepancy and surface a schema drift anomaly. If that change is intended, then you should establish new baseline to reconcile the schema state again.

In this section, you’ll be guided through this process.

1. You can use an external GUI or terminal to make a change to `test_db` . In this tutorial, we use Bytebase **SQL Editor’s Admin mode** which also counts when we say **change outside of Bytebase**. Go to **SQL Editor**, and switch to **Admin mode**.

   When you make a change in **Admin Mode**, it will not record any history as in a normal process [www.bytebase.com/docs/sql-editor/admin-mode](https://www.bytebase.com/docs/sql-editor/admin-mode)

   ![bb-sql-editor-admin](/content/docs/tutorials/database-change-management-with-spanner/bb-sql-editor-admin.webp)

2. Paste the following and then press **Enter**:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE t1 ADD COLUMN Gender STRING(255);
   ```

3. Paste the following and then press **Enter** to verify it’s there:

   ```sql
   SELECT
   table_name,
   column_name,
   data_type
   FROM
   information_schema.columns
   WHERE
   table_name = 't1';
   ```

4. Wait for 10 mins (as Bytebase does the check roughly every 10 mins). Go to **Anomaly Center**, and you can find the **Schema Drift**.
   ![bb-ac-schema-drift](/content/docs/tutorials/database-change-management-with-spanner/bb-ac-schema-drift.webp)

5. Click on **View diff**, you will see the exact drift.

6. You may also find the drift by clicking **Databases** > `test_db`.
   ![bb-db-schema-drift](/content/docs/tutorials/database-change-management-with-spanner/bb-db-schema-drift.webp)

7. Go to **Databases** > `test_db` > **Change History** and click **Establish new baseline**, this step establishes a new baseline to reconcile the schema state from the live database schema.

8. Bytebase will create an issue to establish the new baseline, click **Create**, and then **Resolve** to mark it done.
9. Go back to **Databases** >`test_db` or **Anomaly Center**, and you will find the drift is gone.

## Summary and What's Next

Now you have connected Spanner with Bytebase, and used the UI workflow to accomplish schema change and data change. Bytebase will record the full change history for you. Furthermore, the **Enterprise Plan** is equipped with **Schema Drift Detection** to detect out-of-band schema changes performed outside of Bytebase.

In the [next post](/docs/tutorials/database-change-management-with-spanner-and-github), you’ll try out GitOps workflow: store your Spanner schema in GitHub and Bytebase will pick up the changes to the repo, bringing your Spanner change workflow to the next level, aka **Database DevOps** - [Database as Code](https://www.bytebase.com/blog/database-as-code).
