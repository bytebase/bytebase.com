When you have a team of developers, it is critical to restrict their access to data to only what they need to do their job. This ensures to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.

This tutorial will walk you through how to control data access.

## Prerequisites

- Bytebase Enterprise plan. You can [request a free trial](/contact-us).

## Preparation

Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed, and if you don’t have important existing Bytebase data locally, you can start over from scratch by `rm -rf ~/.bytebase/data`.

You’ll need two Bytebase accounts –  one `Admin` and one `Developer`.

- `Admin` is the one who configures the settings.
- `Developer` is the one who should only see information based on the configuration.

### Step 1 - Run Bytebase via Docker

1. Make sure your docker daemon is running, and then start the Bytebase docker container by typing the following command in the terminal.

   <IncludeBlock url="/docs/get-started/install/terminal-docker-run-volume"></IncludeBlock>

### Step 2 - Register Admin and Developer

1. Visit `localhost:8080` in the browser. Register an admin account, we’ll refer to it as `Admin`. This account will be granted `Workspace Admin` role.

1. Log out and register another account.

   ![register](/content/docs/tutorials/how-to-manage-data-access-for-developers/bb-normal-register.webp)

1. Switch back to `Admin`, enter **Projects** section on the left, where you can see a `Sample Project` with two embedded databases mapping to `Test` and `Prod` environments respectively.

   ![bb-proj-db](/content/docs/tutorials/how-to-manage-data-access-for-developers/bb-proj-db.webp)

1. Click **Members** and **Grant Access** to assign `Project Developer` to the other account. Only after this can he see the project.

### Step 3 - Start Enterprise Plan trial and assign license to instances

1. Click your avatar on the upper-right. Click **Start free trial** and **Request 14 days trial (no credit card required)**.

2. You have to click the `Sample Project` selection bar on the upper-left and go **Back to workspace** first.

3. Enter **Instances** section on the left. **Assign License** for both intances here. You may check [Manage License](/docs/administration/license/) for more details.

## Control query data access

Log in as `Developer`, and you can see `Sample Project`. Enter **SQL Editor** on the upper-right. You ought to **Connect to a database** to get started, yet there's no database data. It's because you don't have any database access permission yet.

### Admin grants data query access directly

1. Log in as `Admin`, and go to `Sample Project`. Click **Members** and then **Grant Access**. Choose `Developer` and assign the role `SQL Editor User`, `All` for **Databases**. Click **Confirm**.

1. Log in as `Developer`, and go to SQL Editor. You can see all databases under `Test` and `Prod` environment. Select `hr_prod`, input `SELECT * FROM employee;` and run, you can see the result. Change `employee` to any other tables and run, you can see data as well.

### Developer requests to query data

1. Log in as `Admin`, and go to **CI/CD** > **Custom Approval**. Scroll down to **Request Querier Role**, and choose `Workspace Admin` as **Approval flow**.

1. Go to **CI/CD** > **Risk Center**. Click **Add Rule**. Choose `Request Querier Role` as **Type**. Choose `High` as **Risk**. Click **Load** for the first template on the right. Click **Add**.

1. Log in as `Developer`, and go to `Sample Project`. Enter **Database** > **Databases** on the left and click **Request Querier Role**. Choose **Manual select** and then `salary` table under `Prod` environment. Click **OK**.

1. A request issue is created with the approval flow `Workspace Admin` we just defined.
   ![issue-request](/content/docs/tutorials/how-to-manage-data-access-for-developers/issue-request.webp)

1. Log in as `Admin`, go to this issue and click **Approve**.

1. Log in as `Developer`, and go to SQL Editor. You can see `salary` table under `Prod` environment. Select `hr_prod`, input `SELECT * FROM salary;` and run, you'll see the result.

1. Input `SELECT * FROM employee;` and run, it'll show permission denied because `Developer` has not been granted permission to query `employee` table. You can click **Request Query** to request permission.

## Audit log

As you can see all change history in **Issues** section or under **Change History** page of a certain database. Bytebase also records all the data access activities in the **[Audit Log](/docs/security/audit-log/)** section as well.
