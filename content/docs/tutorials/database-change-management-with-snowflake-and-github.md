## Overview

In the last article [Database CI/CD and Schema Migration with Snowflake](/docs/tutorials/database-change-management-with-snowflake), you have tried **UI workflow** in Bytebase.

This tutorial will bring your Snowflake schema change to the next level by introducing the **GitOps workflow**, where you commit the schema change script to the GitHub repository, which will in turn trigger the schema deployment pipeline in Bytebase.

You can use Bytebase's **Community Plan** to finish the tutorial.

## Prerequisites

Before you start this tutorial, make sure:

- You have followed our previous UI-based change tutorial [Database CI/CD and Schema Migration with Snowflake](/docs/tutorials/database-change-management-with-snowflake).
- You have a Snowflake account with the role `ACCOUNTADMIN`.
- You have a GitHub account.
- You have a public GitHub repository.
- You have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed locally.
- You have a [ngrok](http://ngrok.com/) account.

## Step 1 - Run Bytebase in Docker and set the External URL generated by ngrok

## Step 2 - Find your Snowflake account in Bytebase

1. Visit Bytebase Console through the browser via your ngrok URL. Log in using your account created from the previous tutorial.

1. Create one or two new databases on your Snowflake instances for different environments, refer to [previous tutorial](/docs/tutorials/database-change-management-with-snowflake) if you need help.

## Step 3 - Connect Bytebase with GitHub.com

## Step 4 - Enable GitOps workflow with Snowflake

## Step 5 - Change schema for Snowflake by pushing SQL schema change files to GitHub

1. In your GitHub repository `test-bb-gitops`, create a folder `bytebase`, then create an sql file `202405111600_create_t1.sql`.

   Paste the sql script in it.

   ```text
   CREATE SCHEMA DEMO;
   CREATE TABLE T1
   (
      "id" INTEGER NOT NULL
   );
   ```

1. Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. Click **Merge pull request** to merge the new branch into the main branch.

1. Go to Bytebase, and go into project `Sample Project`. You’ll find there is a new `Push Event` and a new issue created.
   ![bb-push-notification-only](/content/docs/tutorials/database-change-management-share/bb-push-notification-only.webp)

1. Click and go to the issue page, you’ll see

   1. The issue is created via GitHub.com, there's a link to the GitHub commit.
   1. The SQL is exactly the one we have committed to the GitHub repository.
   1. The SQL has passed the automatic task checks and rollout automatically.
   1. Since there're two databases in the project, Bytebase creates a 2-staged pipeline to roll out the change sequentially.
