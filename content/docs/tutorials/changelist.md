[Changelist](/docs/changelist/) allows you to stage a set of ordered changes. Then at a later time,
you can repeatedly apply them to the databases or export them as zip files to apply the changes offline.

This tutorial will instruct you on how to use Changelist to generate an issue that compiles all necessary schema changes sequentially.

The Changelist can include 3 change sources:

- Change history
- Branch diff
- Raw SQL

In the tutorial, we will prepare the `Change history` and `Branch` first and then compose a Changelist
including all 3 sources.

## Step 1 - Run via Docker

1. Install and start [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
1. Open Terminal to run the command:

   <IncludeBlock url="/docs/get-started/install/terminal-docker-run-volume"></IncludeBlock>

   When the Terminal shows the following message, the execution is successful.

   <IncludeBlock url="/docs/get-started/install/terminal-startup-output-success"></IncludeBlock>

   Now you have Bytebase running in Docker.

1. Open Bytebase in [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/), fill in the fields and click **Create admin account**. You'll be redirected to the workspace.

   ![bb-register](/content/docs/tutorials/changelist/bb-register.webp)

1. Follow the **Quikstart** guide on the bottom to click around or dismiss it by now. You can click your avatar on top right and click **Quickstart** on the dropdown menu to reopen it later.

## Step 2 - Create a Schema Change

1. Click **Select Project** on the top left, and choose `Sample Project`.
1. Check `hr_test` and click **Edit Schema**.
   ![bb-proj-db-test](/content/docs/tutorials/changelist/bb-proj-db-test.webp)
1. Via Schema Editor, add a new column to table `employee`:
   - **Name**: `type`
   - **Type**: `text`
   - **Default**: `contract`
   - **Not Null**: checked
     Click **Preview issue**.
     ![bb-prod-edit-schema-type](/content/docs/tutorials/changelist/bb-prod-edit-schema-type.webp)
1. You'll be redirected to an issue preview, click **Create**, an issue will be created automatically. After automatic checks, the issue will be in `Done` state which means the schema change has been applied to `Test` environment.
   ![bb-issue-done-test-type](/content/docs/tutorials/changelist/bb-issue-done-test-type.webp)

1. Click **View change** on the issue, or click **Change History** on the left sidebar and choose. You'll see the schema change diff.
   ![bb-issue-diff-type-test](/content/docs/tutorials/changelist/bb-issue-diff-type-test.webp)

## Step 3 - Create a Branch

1. Within project `Sample Project`, click **Branches** on the left sidebar, and click **+ New Branch**. Give it a **Name**, and choose `Baseline version`, `Prod` and `hr_prod` as **Source**. Click **Create**.

   ![bb-branch-create](/content/docs/tutorials/changelist/bb-branch-create.webp)

1. You'll be redirected to the branch page, click **Edit**, and add a new column to table `employee`:
   - **Name**: `nickname`
   - **Type**: `text`
   - **Default**: empty string
   - **Not Null**: checked
     Click **Save**.
     ![bb-branch-feature-nickname](/content/docs/tutorials/changelist/bb-branch-feature-nickname.webp)

## Step 4 - Create a Changelist

1. Within the project `Sample Project`, click **Changelists** on the left sidebar, and click **+ New Changelist**. Give it a **Name**, and click `Add`. A changelist will be created.

1. Within the changelist, click **+** to add changes.

   ![bb-changelist-empty](/content/docs/tutorials/changelist/bb-changelist-empty.webp)

1. There're three types of change sources: `Change History`, `Branch` and `Raw SQL`.

   ![bb-change-source](/content/docs/tutorials/changelist/bb-change-source.webp)

1. You have already prepared two in the previous steps. Let's add them to the list along with another of raw SQL.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE "public"."employee"
   ADD COLUMN "city" text NOT NULL DEFAULT '';
   ```

   Reorder them like this.

   ![bb-changelist-3](/content/docs/tutorials/changelist/bb-changelist-3.webp)

1. After clicking **Apply to databases**, choose `hr_test` and click **Next**. You'll be redirected to the issue page. These changes are listed as tasks, 1 per each change source and ordered accordingly. Click **Create** to apply them to `Prod` environment. These tasks will be executed in order. If any of them fails, the rest will be blocked.

## Summary

Now that you've learned how to effectively manage database schema changes using Bytebase Changelist, you can leverage this along with Bytebase's other features to streamline your database development process.
