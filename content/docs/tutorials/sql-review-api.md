When modifying data in the database, it's crucial to ensure that the changes are both safe and accurate. Bytebase offers a feature called [SQL Review](/docs/sql-review/overview/), which allows you to evaluate your SQL changes before they are applied to the database. SQL Review can be initiated through the Bytebase GUI, CI or API.
