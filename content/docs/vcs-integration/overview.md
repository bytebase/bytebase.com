Bytebase offers a database-as-code workflow, enabling you to manage database changes directly through your version control system (VCS).

Bytebase GitOps workflow is built upon the [Bytebase API](/docs/api/overview). It provides the ultimate flexibility to customize the GitOps workflow to integrate with your CI/CD pipeline.

## Integrations

Bytebase currently supports the following VCS integrations:

- [GitHub](/docs/vcs-integration/github)
- [GitLab](/docs/vcs-integration/gitlab)
- [Bitbucket](/docs/vcs-integration/bitbucket)
- [Azure DevOps](/docs/vcs-integration/azure-devops)


## API

If our VCS integrations do not meet your needs or you want to integrate with other VCSs, you can use the [Bytebase API](/docs/api/overview) to build your own GitOps workflow.
