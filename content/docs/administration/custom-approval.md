<HintBlock type="info">

- Custom Approval is mostly used by [UI workflow](/docs/change-database/change-workflow/#ui-workflow). If you use [GitOps workflow](/docs/change-database/change-workflow/#gitops-workflow), we recommend you to configure approval in the PR/MR process.
- By default, you **can not** self-approve your own created issue even if you are a qualified approver. You
  can [toggle](/docs/change-database/issue/#self-approval) this behavior under project settings.

</HintBlock>

In **Settings > Custom Approval**, you can choose which approval flow to use for a [risk level](/docs/administration/risk-center) and define approval flows.

An approval flow can contain one or multiple approval nodes. Each approval node specifies a role. Any member
of the role can approve that node. An issue will enter the rollout stage once all nodes have been approved.
Note, depending on how the [rollout policy](/docs/administration/environment-policy/rollout-policy/) is configured,
it may still require another step to roll out the change manually.

![Approval Flow](/content/docs/administration/custom-approval/edit-approval-flow.webp)

To create or update approval flows, click the **Approval Flows** tab.

## Rules

To choose the approval flow for a risk level, click the **Rules** tab.
Choose the preset "Skip manual approval" approval flow for a risk if you don't want an approval flow at all.

## Custom roles

Sometimes, the predefined project roles might not fit your needs. e.g. You require tester to approve.
In that case, you can use [custom roles](/docs/administration/custom-roles).
