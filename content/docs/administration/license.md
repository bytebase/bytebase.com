Bytebase offers three plans to accommodate your bussiness needs: Free, Pro, and Enterprise. For Pro and Enterprise plans, the license consists of two parts: a workspace license and instance licenses. The workspace license involves the workspace features, a specific number of instance licenses, and the maximum number of instances, which is different for the Pro and Enterprise plans. See the table below for more details.

|          | Workspace feature count | Instance License count | Instance count |
|:---------| :---------------------: | :--------------------: | :------------: |
|Pro plan| About 10 | 1 | Up to 20 |
|Enterprise plan| About 20 | 5 | Unlimited |

The instance license enables features for instances. Once you bind a license to an instance, the licensed features can be accessed by the instance. For Pro and Enterprise plans, the instance license controls access to the different features. For example, [custom approval](/content/docs/administration/custom-approval/), [sensitive data masking](/content/docs/security/anonymize-data/), and [AI-based index advisor](/content/docs/slow-query/index-advisor/#index-advisor) are only available to the licensed instance in the Enterprise plan. If you require more instance licenses, you can purchase instances license seperately. However, you must have a license for the Pro or the Enterprise plan. For more information, you can visit [our pricing page](https://www.bytebase.com/pricing/) or [contact us](mailto:support@bytebase.com?subject=pricing-license).
