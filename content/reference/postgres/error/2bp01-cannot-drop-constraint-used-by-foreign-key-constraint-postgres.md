## Error Message

```sql
ERROR: cannot drop constraint used by foreign key constraint
```

## Description

This error occurs when you attempt to drop a constraint (typically a primary key or unique constraint) that is referenced by a foreign key in another table. PostgreSQL prevents this operation to maintain referential integrity.

## Causes

- Dropping a primary key that is referenced by a foreign key
- Dropping a unique constraint that is referenced by a foreign key
- Altering a table in a way that would remove a referenced constraint
- Running migrations without considering dependencies

## Solutions

### 1. Drop the dependent foreign key constraints first

```sql
-- Identify the foreign key constraint
SELECT conname, conrelid::regclass
FROM pg_constraint
WHERE contype = 'f' AND confrelid = 'departments'::regclass;

-- Drop the foreign key constraint first
ALTER TABLE employees DROP CONSTRAINT employees_dept_id_fkey;

-- Now you can drop the primary key constraint
ALTER TABLE departments DROP CONSTRAINT departments_pkey;
```

### 2. Use CASCADE option (with caution)

```sql
-- This will drop the constraint and all dependent objects
ALTER TABLE departments DROP CONSTRAINT departments_pkey CASCADE;
```

<HintBlock type="warning">

Using CASCADE will automatically drop all dependent objects, which can lead to unexpected data integrity issues. Always perform a backup before using this in production.

</HintBlock>

### 3. Identify dependent foreign keys

```sql
-- Find all foreign keys that reference a specific table
SELECT
    tc.constraint_name,
    tc.table_schema,
    tc.table_name,
    kcu.column_name,
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name
FROM
    information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
    JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
      ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
    JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
      ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
AND ccu.table_name = 'your_table_name';
```

## Prevention Best Practices

1. Plan your schema changes with consideration for constraint dependencies
2. Drop dependent objects before dropping referenced objects
3. Create referenced objects before creating dependent objects
4. Use database versioning tools to manage schema changes
5. Test migrations in development environments before applying to production

<HintBlock type="info">

For complex scenarios with many dependencies, you might need to map out the dependency hierarchy and drop constraints in the correct order.
