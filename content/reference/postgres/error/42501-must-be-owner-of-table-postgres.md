title: 'ERROR 42501: Must be owner of table in Postgres'
---

## Description

This error occurs when a user attempts to perform an operation that requires ownership privileges on a table, such as altering the table structure, dropping the table, or changing ownership.

## Causes

- User is not the owner of the table
- Tables created by different users (e.g., admin, migration tools)
- Ownership issues after database restoration or cloning
- Role membership changes

## Solutions

1. **Check current ownership**:

   ```sql
   SELECT tablename, tableowner
   FROM pg_tables
   WHERE tablename = 'mytable';
   ```

2. **Switch to the owner role** (if you have permission):

   ```sql
   SET ROLE owner_username;
   -- Perform your operations
   RESET ROLE;
   ```

3. **Transfer ownership** (requires superuser or current owner):

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE table_name OWNER TO new_owner;
   ```

4. **For multiple objects**, use bulk transfer:

   ```sql
   REASSIGN OWNED BY old_owner TO new_owner;
   ```

## Prevention

- Use consistent ownership patterns when creating tables
- Document table ownership in your database schema
- Consider using role-based permissions instead of ownership-dependent operations
- Plan ownership structure before database migrations

Cloud database providers typically don't allow superuser privileges. Check with your provider about their specific permission model.
