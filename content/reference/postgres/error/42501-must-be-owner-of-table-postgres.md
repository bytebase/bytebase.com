## Overview

The `Must be owner of table` error in PostgreSQL occurs when a user attempts to perform an operation that requires ownership privileges on a table, such as altering the table's structure, dropping the table, or changing ownership. This error indicates that the user executing the command does not have sufficient rights on the table to carry out the operation. Common ownership errors are:

```bash
ERROR:  must be owner of table mytable
ERROR:  must be owner of relation users
ERROR:  must be owner of schema public
```

## Root Causes of Ownership Issues

### 1. Disconnected Database Users Between Creation and Operation

**Database User Mismatch**: Objects in PostgreSQL are owned by the database user that created them, not the user who needs to operate on them later.

- **Third-Party Tools and Services**: When external services, ORMs, or migration frameworks connect using their own database users to create objects
- **Administrative Setup**: Tables and schemas created by DBAs using admin accounts (often `postgres`) during initial database setup
- **Deployment Pipelines**: CI/CD systems that use dedicated database users different from application users

### 2. Environment Transitions and Data Movement

When database objects move between environments, ownership information often becomes problematic:

- **Database Dumps and Restores**: When migrating between development, staging, and production environments
- **Database Cloning**: Creating copies of databases where user accounts don't match between source and target
- **Cloud Platform Provisioning**: When cloud providers or DBaaS offerings provision databases under system accounts

### 3. PostgreSQL's Ownership and Permission Model

PostgreSQL enforces a strict ownership model by design:

- **Exclusive Ownership Rules**: Unlike some database systems, PostgreSQL gives certain privileges exclusively to owners that cannot be delegated
- **Inherited Object Creation**: Objects created as side-effects (constraints, indexes, sequences) inherit the ownership of the parent object
- **Schema and Cross-Schema References**: Ownership chains that must be navigated for cross-schema operations

### 4. Temporary Access and Privilege Management

Issues arising from temporary access patterns:

- **Temporary Privilege Escalation**: When users temporarily gain higher privileges to create objects but don't transfer ownership afterward
- **Role Membership Changes**: Users removed from roles that owned certain objects
- **Session-Based Object Creation**: Objects created during specific sessions that retain the session user's ownership

## Identify Current Ownership

```sql
-- Check table ownership
SELECT tablename, tableowner
FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename = 'mytable';

-- For schemas
SELECT n.nspname AS schema,
       r.rolname AS owner
FROM pg_namespace n
JOIN pg_roles r ON n.nspowner = r.oid
WHERE n.nspname = 'myschema';
```

## Switch to the Owner Role

If possible, connect to the database as the owner:

```sql
-- First, find out if you can switch to that role
SELECT r.rolname, r.rolsuper, r.rolinherit,
       r.rolcreaterole, r.rolcreatedb, r.rolcanlogin,
       ARRAY(SELECT b.rolname
             FROM pg_catalog.pg_auth_members m
             JOIN pg_catalog.pg_roles b ON (m.roleid = b.oid)
             WHERE m.member = r.oid) as memberof
FROM pg_catalog.pg_roles r
WHERE r.rolname = 'owner_username';

-- Then switch roles if you have permission
SET ROLE owner_username;

-- After operations, switch back to your original role
RESET ROLE;
```

## Performing Ownership-Required Operations

Operations like `ALTER TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, or `REINDEX TABLE` require the user to be the owner of the table or a superuser in PostgreSQL.

If it's appropriate for the user to own the table, an existing superuser or the current owner can change the table's ownership to the user. This can be done using the `ALTER TABLE` command:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name OWNER TO new_owner;
```

## Lack of Superuser Privileges

Even if a user has been granted all privileges on a table, certain operations still require superuser status or ownership of the table because these operations can affect the table's fundamental structure or behavior.

For operations that necessarily require superuser privileges, perform the operation using a superuser account. This approach should be used cautiously, as superuser accounts have unrestricted access to the database system.

Also note, cloud database providers only provide semi-superuser privileges. You can't perform certain operations at all.

If changing ownership or using a superuser account is not feasible, you can also manage access through roles. A superuser can grant the role that owns the table to the user needing to perform the operation:

```sql
GRANT role_name TO user_name;
```

## Use `EVENT TRIGGER` to Change Ownership after Table Creation

In scenarios where tables are frequently created and ownership needs to be managed dynamically, consider using event triggers to automatically change ownership of newly created tables to a specific role or user

You can also use `EVENT TRIGGER` to automate the ownership changes.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fn_change_table_ownership()
RETURNS event_trigger
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
    obj record;
BEGIN
    FOR obj IN SELECT * FROM pg_event_trigger_ddl_commands() WHERE command_tag = 'CREATE TABLE'
    LOOP
        -- Change the ownership of the table. Replace 'new_owner' with the desired role or user.
        EXECUTE 'ALTER TABLE ' || obj.schema_name || '.' || obj.object_name || ' OWNER TO new_owner';
    END LOOP;
END;
$$;
```

After creating the function, the next step is to create an event trigger that fires on `CREATE TABLE` events.
This trigger will call the function you just created.

```sql
CREATE EVENT TRIGGER trg_change_table_ownership
ON ddl_command_end
WHEN TAG IN ('CREATE TABLE')
EXECUTE FUNCTION fn_change_table_ownership();
```

This trigger activates after any `CREATE TABLE` operation completes and calls the fn_change_table_ownership() function to change the ownership of the newly created table(s).

## Bulk Change Ownership

For multiple objects needing ownership changes, use `REASSIGN OWNED`:

```sql
-- Transfer all objects owned by old_owner to new_owner
REASSIGN OWNED BY old_owner TO new_owner;
```
