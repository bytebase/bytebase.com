## Introduction

The official [MySQL Client `mysql`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql.html), also known as MySQL CLI is a CLI to interact with your MySQL server. Below describe how to install it on Mac, Ubuntu, CentOS and Windows respectively.

## Before You Start

Before you start, you should confirm that you don't have MySQL client installed. If you have installed MySQL server before, likely
you will have MySQL client installed as well. If you see something like below, then MySQL client is already installed and you can stop reading now.

```bash
$ mysql --version
mysql  Ver 8.0.31 for macos13.0 on arm64 (Homebrew)
```

## Test Connection

After you install the MySQL client following the below instruction, you can test the connection to your MySQL server using

```bash
mysql -h hostname -u username -p
```

## Install on Mac

### Homebrew

To install MySQL Shell using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you need to install Homebrew on your Mac first. If you arenâ€™t sure if you have installed Homebrew already, open your terminal and run the following command to check.

```bash
brew -v
```

If not installed, run the following command to install Homebrew first:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once Homebrew is installed, run the following command to update the list of available packages:

```bash
brew update
```

To install the MySQL client, run the following command:

```bash
brew install mysql-client
```

After the installation is complete, you can verify that the MySQL client is installed by running the following command:

```bash
mysql --version
```

Note: If you have previously installed the MySQL server using Homebrew, you may need to run the following command to link the MySQL client:

```bash
brew link --overwrite mysql-client
```

### DMG Package

1. Go to the MySQL website and download the DMG package for the MySQL client. The current version can be found at https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/.
1. Double-click the downloaded DMG file to mount it. A new window will appear with the MySQL package.
1. Double-click the package to start the installation process, and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
1. Once the installation is complete, you can verify that the MySQL client is installed by opening a Terminal window and running the following command:

   ```bash
   mysql --version
   ```

This should display the version number of the MySQL client that you just installed.

Note: If you have previously installed the MySQL server using a package manager like Homebrew, you may need to specify the path to the MySQL client binary when running commands. The default location for the MySQL client binary installed with the DMG package is /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql.
