## 1. Secure Installation and Initial Configuration

**Minimal Installation**

- Install only what you need to reduce your attack surface.
- Avoid unnecessary components, demo databases, and sample data.
- Secure file permissions on MySQL directories and configuration files.

**Initial Hardening Checklist**

1. **Secure the Root Account**: Set a strong password for the root user and implement password validation.

2. **Remove Anonymous Accounts**: Check for and remove any anonymous users that might exist by default.

3. **Remove Test Database**: Drop the test database and remove associated privileges.

4. **Restrict Network Access**: Configure MySQL to bind only to necessary network interfaces.

5. **Disable Remote Root Login**: Ensure root can only connect from localhost.

6. **Change Default Port**: Consider changing the default port (3306) to reduce automated scanning.

7. **Configure Error Logging**: Enable detailed error logging for security monitoring.

8. **Set Secure File Privileges**: Restrict where MySQL can read and write files.

9. **Disable LOCAL INFILE**: Prevent the potential exploitation of the `LOCAL INFILE` command.

## 2. Authentication and User Management

**Role and User Management**

- Create dedicated user accounts with appropriate privileges.
- Implement role-based access control (MySQL 8.0+).
- Regularly audit user accounts to identify and remove unnecessary or outdated accounts.
- Set resource limits to prevent abuse.

**Password Policies and Secure Password Storage**

- Use strong authentication plugins (`caching_sha2_password` in MySQL 8.0+).
- Implement password validation with strong policies.
- Configure password expiration to force regular password changes.

**Account Locking on Suspicious Activity:** MySQL 8.0.19+ supports automatic account locking after failed login attempts. Configure this feature to protect against brute force attacks.

**Restricting Superuser Access**

- Limit root login locations to localhost only.
- Create administrative users with limited privileges instead of using root.
- Enable logging for all root activities.

## 3. Authorization and Access Control

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Create role hierarchies for more complex permission structures and assign roles to users based on their job functions.

**Using GRANT and REVOKE Properly**

- Grant only the specific privileges needed.
- Restrict access at the column level for sensitive data.
- Regularly review and revoke unnecessary privileges.
- Use `WITH GRANT OPTION` carefully.

**Implementing Row-Level Security:** MySQL 8.0 doesn't have built-in row-level security like PostgreSQL, but you can implement it using views with WHERE clauses or through stored procedures.

**Dynamic Privileges:** MySQL 8.0 introduced dynamic privileges for fine-grained control over administrative operations, allowing you to grant specific administrative capabilities without providing full admin access.

**Securing Stored Procedures and Functions:** Be cautious with SECURITY DEFINER in stored procedures, as it allows procedures to run with the privileges of the creator, which can be a security risk if not properly managed.

## 4. Data Encryption

**Encryption in Transit**

- Configure SSL/TLS in MySQL.
- Create and properly manage SSL/TLS certificates.
- Require encrypted connections for sensitive users or globally.
- Configure appropriate TLS versions and ciphers.

**Encryption at Rest**

- Enable tablespace encryption for database files.
- Configure the keyring for key management.
- Encrypt binary logs, redo logs, and undo logs.
- Consider encrypting the system tablespace and temporary tablespace.

**Column-Level Encryption:** For more granular control, encrypt specific columns containing sensitive data using MySQL's encryption functions or application-level encryption.

**Encrypting Backup Files:** Ensure that backup files are also encrypted to protect sensitive data in backups.

## 5. Network Security

**Restricting Network Access**

- Bind MySQL to specific IP addresses instead of all interfaces.
- Change the default port to reduce automated scanning.
- Limit which hosts can connect to specific MySQL users.

**Firewall Configuration:** Configure host-level firewall rules to restrict MySQL access to only necessary sources.

**Using VPNs and SSH Tunnels:** Use VPNs or SSH tunneling to provide encrypted access to MySQL without exposing the port publicly.

**Network Monitoring and Intrusion Detection**

- Regularly monitor connections to your MySQL server.
- Set appropriate connection limits.
- Implement connection control to prevent brute force attacks.

## 6. Auditing and Monitoring

Check [MySQL Auditing](/reference/mysql/how-to/how-to-enable-auditing-mysql/)

## 7. Patching and Maintenance

**Staying Informed About Security Announcements:** Subscribe to the MySQL security announcements mailing list and regularly check the MySQL Security Advisories page.

**Regular Configuration Reviews:** Schedule regular reviews of your MySQL configuration to ensure security settings remain appropriate.

**Maintaining User Accounts and Privileges:** Regularly audit user accounts and privileges to identify and remove unnecessary access.

**Upgrade Strategies**

- For minor version updates, follow standard upgrade procedures.
- For major version upgrades, use a more cautious approach.
- Consider blue-green deployment for upgrades in production environments.
- Always test upgrades in staging environments first.

## 8. Backup and Disaster Recovery

**Implementing Encrypted Backups:** Always encrypt your MySQL backups to protect sensitive data.

Always encrypt your MySQL backups to protect sensitive data.

**Secure Backup Storage:** Apply the 3-2-1 backup rule:

- Keep 3 copies of your data
- Store backups on 2 different storage types
- Keep 1 copy offsite

**Backup Authentication and Authorization:** Create a dedicated backup user with minimal necessary privileges.

**Automated Backup Verification:** Regularly verify your backups to ensure they can be successfully restored.

**Implementing High Availability:** Consider high availability configurations to reduce downtime during incidents.

**Testing Disaster Recovery Procedures:** Regularly test your disaster recovery procedures to ensure they work when needed.

## 9. Advanced Security Techniques

**MySQL Enterprise Firewall:** MySQL Enterprise Edition includes a firewall that provides protection against SQL injection attacks by learning legitimate query patterns.

**MySQL Enterprise Data Masking:** For environments handling sensitive data, MySQL Enterprise Edition offers data masking capabilities to protect sensitive information.

**OS-Level Protections:** Enhance MySQL security with operating system level protections like AppArmor or SELinux.

**Connection Pooling and Throttling:** Implement connection pooling and query rate limiting to improve security and performance.

## 10. Common Mistakes and Vulnerabilities

Even with the best intentions, MySQL databases often remain vulnerable due to common security mistakes.

**Using Default or Weak Credentials:** One of the most common and dangerous security mistakes is using default or weak credentials.

**Excessive Privileges:** Granting excessive privileges violates the principle of least privilege and increases the potential damage from compromised accounts.

**SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:** SQL injection remains one of the most dangerous threats to database security. Always use prepared statements in application code.

**Unencrypted Connections:** Transmitting data in plaintext exposes it to interception. Enable SSL/TLS and require encrypted connections.

**Failing to Apply Security Patches:** Failing to apply security patches promptly leaves databases vulnerable to known exploits.

**Insecure Configuration Settings:** Default MySQL configurations often prioritize convenience over security. Review and secure your configuration.

**Lack of Monitoring and Auditing:** Without proper monitoring, security breaches can go undetected. Enable appropriate logging and regularly review logs.
