title: 'ERROR 1040 (HY000): Too Many Connections'
---

## Error Message

```sql
ERROR 1040 (HY000): Too many connections
```

## Description

This error occurs when the MySQL server has reached its maximum allowed number of concurrent client connections. The server is unable to accept any new connections until existing connections are closed or terminated.

## Causes

- Low `max_connections` setting (default is often too low, typically 151)
- Connection leaks in applications (not properly closing connections)
- Inefficient connection pooling configuration
- Long-running queries holding connections open
- Sleeping connections consuming connection slots
- Sudden increases in application traffic
- Unclosed transactions keeping connections active
- Insufficient server resources to handle more connections

## Solutions

1. **Increase max_connections limit**:

   ```sql
   -- Check current max_connections value
   SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'max_connections';

   -- Increase max_connections temporarily
   SET GLOBAL max_connections = 500;

   -- For permanent changes, modify my.cnf/my.ini:
   # max_connections = 500
   ```

2. **Implement connection pooling**:

   Configure connection pools in your application:

   ```
   # Example pool settings:
   pool_size = 10           # Base connections
   pool_max_size = 20       # Maximum connections
   pool_idle_timeout = 300  # Seconds before idle connection is closed
   ```

3. **Terminate idle connections**:

   ```sql
   -- Show current connections and their state
   SHOW PROCESSLIST;

   -- Kill long-running or sleeping connections
   KILL CONNECTION connection_id;
   ```

4. **Configure connection timeouts**:

   ```sql
   -- Reduce timeout values
   SET GLOBAL wait_timeout = 300;         -- Close inactive connections after 5 minutes
   SET GLOBAL interactive_timeout = 300;   -- Close inactive client connections after 5 minutes
   ```

## Prevention

1. **Use connection pooling** in your applications (HikariCP, DBCP, PDO)

2. **Properly manage connections** in application code:

   - Always close connections after use
   - Use try-finally blocks to ensure connections are released
   - Implement connection reuse

3. **Monitor active connections**:

   ```sql
   -- Check current connection count
   SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Threads_connected';
   ```

4. **Optimize slow queries** that hold connections open:
   ```sql
   -- Enable slow query log
   SET GLOBAL slow_query_log = 'ON';
   SET GLOBAL long_query_time = 1;
   ```

<HintBlock type="info">
Increasing max_connections requires more memory. Each connection consumes server resources, so simply increasing this value without addressing underlying issues can lead to performance problems. Connection pooling is often a better solution.
