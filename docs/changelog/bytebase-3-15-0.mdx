## 🔔 Project-level Service Accounts & Workload Identities

We introduce project-level Service Accounts and Workload Identities in addition to the existing workspace-level scope. This enables project-scoped machine identities to follow least privilege and reduce automation blast radius, while clearly separating machine identities from users and aligning them with the resource hierarchy.

- **UI & scope changes**

  - Workspace Members page now has separate tabs for Users&Groups, Service Accounts, and Workload Identities.
  - Service accounts and workload identities can now be created at both workspace and project levels, governed by their respective IAM policies.
  - Project-level identities are scoped to a single project to enable isolated automation.
  - The account selector for role assignment now supports users, groups, service accounts, and workload identities. Service accounts and workload identities require entering the full email address.

- **Breaking changes (API / Terraform users)**

  - Machine identities are managed via dedicated APIs (`ServiceAccountService`, `WorkloadIdentityService`) instead of the User API.
  - IAM member prefixes updated:
   `user:{email}` → `serviceAccount:{email}` / `workloadIdentity:{email}`
  - Workspace-level Service Account and Workload Identity APIs now require explicit parent `workspaces/-` instead of an empty string.  
    Affected APIs: `CreateServiceAccount`, `ListServiceAccounts`, `CreateWorkloadIdentity`, `ListWorkloadIdentities`.  
    Endpoint change:  
    `/v1/serviceAccounts` → `/v1/workspaces/-/serviceAccounts`
  - Terraform users must update IAM member prefixes and use the new service account/workload identity resources. [Latest provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/bytebase/bytebase/latest/docs)

## 🔔 Other Notable Changes

- **SQL Editor settings consolidation & policy updates**
  - Add a dedicated **SQL Editor** section under **Workspace Settings > General**, consolidating data export, data copying, admin data source access, max result size, max result rows, and max query time.
  - **Max result rows** can also be configured at the project level.
  - `DataSourceQueryPolicy` is merged into `QueryDataPolicy` and deprecated (auto-migrated).
  - DDL/DML execution control is now configured at the project role level using `bb.sql.ddl` and `bb.sql.dml` permissions. The previous `disallow_ddl` / `disallow_dml` environment policy is removed.
  - For Terraform users, the settings update also affect Terraform, need to update bytebase_policy configuration. [Latest provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/bytebase/bytebase/latest/docs)

- **Role & permission adjustments**
  - Add `bb.taskRuns.create` permission to the **Project Owner** role.
  - Remove `bb.rollouts.create` permission from the **Project Developer** role (use **Project Releaser** or **Project Owner**).
  - Allow managing project IAM policy without the **Project Owner** role.

- **Online migration configuration change**
  - Move gh-ost configuration from Plan spec to SQL directive in sheet content (`-- gh-ost = { ... }`).
  - Remove `enable_ghost` and `ghost_flags` from `ChangeDatabaseConfig` in the Plan API.

- **Execution & validation improvements**
  - Skip DML dry-run checks when DDL statements are present to reduce false positives. Primarily applied to SQL Review rule `Validate the executability of DML statements`.

- **Cleanup & removals**
  - Remove the **Archived** page (archived projects and instances now appear directly in the dashboard).
  - Remove `auto_enable_backup` and `skip_backup_errors` from project settings.
  - Deprecate the legacy issue page and route.

## 🚀 Features

- **MongoDB**
  - Use native driver for queries by default, with fallback to `mongosh`.
  - SQL Editor now supports auto-complete, current statement highlighting, and syntax checking.
  - Support statement-type access control in SQL Editor, allowing administrators to control Read and Write permissions.

- **Elasticsearch**
  - Support statement-type access control in SQL Editor, allowing administrators to control Read and Write permissions.

## 🎄 Enhancements

- SQL Editor query results support multi-select via Cmd/Ctrl + Click for rows and columns. Copied data now includes column names.
- Improve the SQL Editor database connection panel layout.
- Normalize Unicode emails to prevent creating accounts with visually identical but technically different addresses.

## 🐞 Bug Fixes

- Fix access token refresh on SQL Editor LSP websocket reconnection.
- Fix incorrect Learn More link for online migration.
- **Google Cloud SQL** - Fix IAM authentication while creating instances in Bytebase Cloud.
- **PostgreSQL** - Support Common Table Expressions (CTE) in backup statement execution.
