## 🔔 Notable Changes

- Redesign the database CI/CD workflow to align with industry practices (GitHub, GitLab) by clearly separating **CI (review)** and **CD (deployment)** phases:
  <Expandable title="details" defaultOpen={false}>
    - Issue page now displays plan changes directly - no more context switching between tabs.
    - Rollout is now a standalone deployment page, clearly separating review from execution.
    - Rollout UI now supports release-based tasks — showing per-file execution status, command duration, and release info in task items.
    - Rollout creation: previously rollout is created at the same time when issue is created, but now it's creation is decoupled from issue creation, with 2 creation modes: 1) automatic creation, if issue is approved AND SQL review check pass; 2) user can manually create in other cases (most common case, issue approved BUT review not passed, and there should be an action button).
    - As a result of mode 2, project releaser might need to create rollout manually before executing rollout, so `bb.rollouts.create` permission is added to project releaser role. All custom roles for rollout initiation are advised to be assigned `bb.rollouts.create` permission. This permission only controls who can create a rollout; it does not bypass approval requirements or task execution.
  </Expandable>
  
- Improve permission guards and access control:
  <Expandable title="details" defaultOpen={false}>
  - Stop hiding UI elements when users lack permissions and show a no permission alert instead. Allow users to request roles directly from the UI.
  - Allow **Project Owners** to disable the self-service role request workflow in **Project Settings**.
  - Introduce more granular permission management:
    - Add new policy permissions:
      - `bb.policies.getMaskingRulePolicy`
      - `bb.policies.updateMaskingRulePolicy`
    - Add new settings permissions:
      - `bb.settings.getEnvironment`
      - `bb.settings.setEnvironment`
      - `bb.settings.getWorkspaceProfile`
      - `bb.settings.setWorkspaceProfile`
    - Permission assignments are updated accordingly:
      - The **Workspace Admin** and **DBA** receive all these new permissions.
      - The **Project Owner** receives the new policy permissions.
      - The **Workspace Member** receives `bb.settings.getEnvironment` and `bb.settings.getWorkspaceProfile`.
  - Tighten **Workspace Members** permissions:
    - Revoke `bb.settings.get`, `bb.settings.list`, `bb.projects.list`.
    - If **Workspace Members** should not access the user list, create a custom role and revoke `bb.users.list` and `bb.users.get`.
  </Expandable>
- Redesign the **Database Changelog** and **Revision** pages.
- Remove **Schema Drift Detection** feature:
  <Expandable title="details" defaultOpen={false}>
  - Remove `drifted` field from `Database message` in `v1/database_service.proto`.
  - Remove `drifted` filter option from `ListDatabases` API (previously supported `drifted == true` filter).
  - Remove `dump_version` field from `ChangelogPayload` in store proto.
  </Expandable>
- Update core APIs `CreateSheet`, `CreatePlan`, `CreateRollout`, and `CreateRelease`, please refer to the latest API documentation for updated request/response definitions.
- Update **Project Webhook events**. Please review the [documentation](/change-database/webhook) for the current list of supported events to ensure your listeners remain compatible.
- Remove `auto_resolve_issue` and `allow_modify_statement` from **Project Settings**.
- Remove `maximum_connections` from **Instance Settings** and use `Parallel tasks per rollout` in **Project Settings** instead.
- Unify `TRUNCATE_TABLE` and `TRUNCATE` into a single `TRUNCATE` statement type for **Custom Approval** CEL expressions.
- Update **Terraform provider**:
  <Expandable title="details" defaultOpen={false}>
  - Remove `allow_modify_statement` and `auto_resolve_issue` from the project resource.
  - Remove `auto_resolve_issue` from the workspace_profile setting resource.
  - Remove `maximum_connections` from the instance resource.
  - The `notification_types` in the project webhook are changed to `ISSUE_CREATED`, `ISSUE_APPROVAL_REQUESTED`, `ISSUE_SENT_BACK`, `PIPELINE_FAILED` and `PIPELINE_COMPLETED`.
  - Support configure `allow_request_role`, `data_classification_config_id`, `enforce_sql_review`, `force_issue_labels`, `issue_labels`, `labels`, `require_issue_approval`, `require_plan_check_no_error` for the project resource.
  </Expandable>
