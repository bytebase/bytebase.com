## 🔔 Notable Changes

- **Consolidate DDL and DML changes** so users no longer need to select them explicitly.
- Update SQL review configuration for Terraform: (e.g. [sql_review.tf](https://github.com/bytebase/terraform-provider-bytebase/blob/main/examples/setup/sql_review.tf))
  - SQL review rules use typed payload fields (`number_payload`, `string_payload`, `string_array_payload`, `naming_payload`, etc.).
  - Generic payload and comment fields are removed.
  - Rule level enums from `SQLReviewRuleLevel_WARNING/ERROR` to `SQLReviewRule_WARNING/ERROR`.
- **Simplify approval workflows**:
  - Approval flows are defined directly using CEL expressions, without intermediate risk definitions.
  - Risk evaluation uses system presets.
  - `risk.level` is an optional CEL factor for CHANGE_DATABASE approval flows.
  - For Terraform, approval flows are defined via bytebase_setting (settings/WORKSPACE_APPROVAL) using approval_flow.rules.flow, and risk resources are removed.(e.g. [approval_flow.tf](https://github.com/bytebase/terraform-provider-bytebase/blob/main/examples/setup/approval_flow.tf))
- Move rollout policy checkers (**Require issue approval**, **Plan check enforcement**) from environment to project.
- Rename **Masking Exception** to **Masking Exemption**:
  - APIs rename `MaskingException` to `MaskingExemption`.
  - The action field is removed.
  - `member` is replaced with a `members` list.
  - For Terraform, `masking_exception_policy` is renamed to `masking_exemption_policy`.
- **Disallow Copy Policy** now applies to Admin and DBA roles (previously exempted).
- Refine database group permissions:
  - Roles with `bb.projects.get` gain `bb.databaseGroups.list/get`.
  - Roles with `bb.projects.update` gain `bb.databaseGroups.create/update/delete`.
- Migrate user identifiers: User references change from `users/{id}` to `users/{email}` in APIs and storage. Audit logs store user emails directly.
- Update batch task APIs: The `reason` field is removed from `BatchRunTasks` and `BatchCancelTaskRuns`. `reason` is supported only for skip operations.
- Remove **SchemaTemplate** functionality.

## 🚀 Features

- Support **MCP integration** under Workspace Integration > MCP.
- Add **Workload Identity** as a dedicated account type for OIDC-based authentication, with **GitHub Actions** support.
- Support direct messages for **Microsoft Teams**.

## 🎄 Enhancements

- Improve the rollout page with a timeline view, auto-expanded task details, and collapsible task run logs with auto-refresh.
- Allow filtering in SQL Editor results to quickly locate rows.
- Allow selecting a database group to query from in the SQL Editor.
- **Snowflake** - Support passphrase-protected private keys.
- **PostgreSQL** - Add event trigger sync and SDL support.
- **Trino** - Support TLS/SSL.
- **Doris** - Improve SQL parser compatibility.
