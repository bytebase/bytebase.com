## License Overview

Bytebase offers [3 pricing plans](https://www.bytebase.com/pricing): `Free`, `Pro`, `Enterprise`. Both `Pro` and `Enterprise` plans require purchasing license. You can [contact us](https://www.bytebase.com/contact-us/) to request a 2-week free trial.

### Workspace vs Instance Licenses

Bytebase uses a two-tier licensing model:

**Workspace License**

- Applied to your entire Bytebase workspace
- Unlocks plan-level features (Pro or Enterprise)
- Must be configured first before assigning instance licenses

**Instance Licenses**

- Applied to individual database instances to activate instance-specific features
- Allocated from your workspace license quota
- Can be assigned/unassigned as needed to optimize costs

<Note>
  You must first upload a workspace license, then assign the instance license quota to specific instances
  that need advanced features.
</Note>

### License Quota

A license includes an **instance quota**, which defines:

- The number of **active database instances** (with assigned instance-level licenses)
- The **total number of instances** allowed under the plan

### Plan Details

- Under the **Pro** plan, purchasing **1 to 20 user seats** includes **10 active database instances at no additional cost**.

- Under the **Enterprise** plan, you must purchase a license with a minimum quota of **10 active instances**.

### Feature Availability

- **Enterprise-wide features**, such as [SSO](/administration/sso/overview/) and [Watermark](/security/watermark/) are **not instance-specific** and are available as long as you hold an Enterprise license.

- **Instance-specific features**, such as [Dynamic Data Masking](/security/data-masking/overview), **require assigning quota** to individual instances to be activated.
  For full details, see our [pricing page](https://www.bytebase.com/pricing/).

<Tip>

To reduce costs, you can license only a subset of your instances (e.g., production instances only).

1. Go to **Database > Databases** to choose the database this table belongs to.

1. Find the row representing your table, and click the `Classification` field you want to apply data masking.
