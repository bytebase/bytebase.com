Optimize migration performance in your GitOps workflow.

## Performance Optimization

### Batch Large Data Migrations

For DML on large tables, process in batches:

```sql
-- 050__archive_old_logs_dml.sql
-- Instead of single large DELETE:
-- ❌ DELETE FROM logs WHERE created_at < '2024-01-01';

-- Use batched approach:
DO $$
DECLARE
    batch_size INT := 10000;
    deleted_count INT;
BEGIN
    LOOP
        DELETE FROM logs
        WHERE id IN (
            SELECT id FROM logs
            WHERE created_at < '2024-01-01'
            LIMIT batch_size
        );

        GET DIAGNOSTICS deleted_count = ROW_COUNT;
        EXIT WHEN deleted_count < batch_size;

        COMMIT; -- If supported
        PERFORM pg_sleep(0.1); -- Throttle
    END LOOP;
END $$;
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces lock contention
- Prevents transaction log bloat
- Allows monitoring progress
- Can be paused/resumed

### Use Online Schema Changes for Large Tables

For MySQL tables > 1M rows:

```sql
-- Instead of:
-- ❌ 010__add_index.sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);

-- Use gh-ost:
-- ✅ 010__add_index_ghost.sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD INDEX idx_users_email (email);
```

### Optimize Index Creation

Create indexes concurrently when possible:

```sql
-- PostgreSQL: Non-blocking index creation
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_email ON users(email);

-- MySQL: Use online DDL
ALTER TABLE users ADD INDEX idx_email (email), ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK=NONE;
```

**Note:** `CONCURRENTLY` requires:
- Cannot be in transaction block
- Takes longer than regular index creation
- May fail if concurrent writes conflict

### Timing Considerations

**Best times for migrations:**
- ✅ Low-traffic hours (nights, weekends)
- ✅ During maintenance windows
- ✅ After application deployments

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Peak business hours
- ❌ During critical operations (month-end, sales events)
- ❌ Without communication to stakeholders

### Monitor Migration Performance

Track execution time during development:

```sql
-- Add timing to migration
\timing on
-- Migration SQL here
\timing off
```

Set expectations for production:
```sql
-- 015__large_migration.sql
-- Expected duration: 5-10 minutes
-- Locks: users table (write lock)
-- Tested on: 2M row table
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Track Migration Metrics

Monitor these metrics:

| Metric | Target | Alert Threshold |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Migration duration | < 5 min | > 10 min |
| Lock wait time | < 1 sec | > 5 sec |
| Rows affected | Documented | > Expected |
| Rollback success rate | 100% | < 100% |

### Database Health Checks

Before and after migrations:

```sql
-- Check table sizes
SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS size
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;

-- Check index usage
SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    idx_scan,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexrelid)) AS size
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE idx_scan < 100
ORDER BY pg_relation_size(indexrelid) DESC;
```
