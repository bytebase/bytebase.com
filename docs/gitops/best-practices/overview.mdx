This guide provides battle-tested patterns and recommendations for production GitOps workflows with Bytebase.

## What You'll Learn

This best practices guide covers:

- **File Organization** - Repository structures and directory layouts for different team sizes
- **Migration Guidelines** - Version numbering strategies, file best practices, and common pitfalls
- **Git and CI/CD** - Branching strategies, CI/CD patterns, and testing approaches
- **SQL Review and Security** - Review configuration and security best practices

## Who Should Read This

This guide is designed for:

- **DevOps Engineers** setting up database CI/CD pipelines
- **Database Administrators** migrating to GitOps workflows
- **Development Teams** implementing database version control
- **Platform Engineers** building self-service database platforms

## Prerequisites

Before diving into best practices, you should have:

- Basic understanding of [GitOps Workflow](/gitops/overview)
- Familiarity with either [Migration-Based](/gitops/migration-based-workflow/overview) or [State-Based](/gitops/state-based-workflow/overview) workflows
- [GitOps integration installed](/gitops/installation)

## Quick Reference

### Critical Best Practices

**File Management:**
- Use timestamp-based versioning for parallel development
- Keep migrations small and focused (one logical change per file)
- Never modify applied migrations

**Testing:**
- Always test in non-production first: Local → Dev → Staging → Production
- Maintain test data that mirrors production
- Test schema compatibility before deployment

**Security:**
- Use service accounts for CI/CD
- Grant least privilege database access
- Store secrets in secret management systems

**Performance:**
- Batch large data migrations
- Use online schema changes for large tables
- Create indexes concurrently when possible
