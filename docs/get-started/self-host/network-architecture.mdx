title: Network Architecture and External Access
---

This guide explains the network connectivity options for Bytebase features that require external access, including GitOps workflows, SSO authentication, and webhooks.

## Features Requiring External Access

- **GitOps Workflows**: CI/CD platforms (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.) need to call Bytebase API
- **SSO Authentication**: OAuth2/OIDC/SAML providers need callback access
- **Webhooks**: External services sending events to Bytebase

## Three Network Patterns

### 1. Bytebase Cloud
Use [Bytebase Cloud](https://hub.bytebase.com/) for instant setup without infrastructure management. External services connect directly.

**Best for:** Quick testing, evaluation, and small teams

### 2. Self-Hosted Bytebase (Production)

Keep Bytebase inside your private network for security.

**With cloud CI/CD** (GitHub.com, GitLab.com, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps):

- Works without self-hosted runners
- Cloud CI/CD can call Bytebase directly (or via the required exposed endpoint)

**With self-hosted CI/CD** (GitHub Enterprise Server, self-hosted GitLab, Jenkins):

- Install self-hosted runners/agents inside your network
- Runners connect to your internal Bytebase without exposing it to the internet

**Best for:** Production setups with strict network boundaries.

### 3. Self-Hosted Local Testing with Reverse Proxy

Temporarily expose local Bytebase for testing using reverse proxy tools such as:
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
- [VS Code port forwarding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/port-forwarding)
- Other tunneling services

<Warning>
Never use reverse proxy tools in production. They are for local testing only.
</Warning>

<Info>
**Important for Self-Hosted:** Remember to configure the External URL in Bytebase **Settings > General** with your public URL for SSO callbacks and other integrations to work properly.
