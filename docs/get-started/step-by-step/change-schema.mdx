title: 'Step 6: Change Schema'
---

**Issue** serves as the starting point for managing database changes, including `Schema Change (DDL)` and `Data Change (DML)`. These changes follow a structured workflow: **Plan**, **Review**, **Approve**, and **Rollout**. For actions like `Database Creation`, the workflow might be simpler, omitting some steps.

## Initiate an Issue with a Plan

1. Navigate to **CI/CD** > **Plans** in your project menu and click **+ New Plan**.

1. Select one or more databases where the changes will be applied. Click **Confirm** to proceed.

1. Input the SQL statement you want to apply to the database. You may click **Schema Editor** to visually design the schema if needed.

## Review the Issue

1. Before clicking **Create**, you may choose to **Run checks** to execute the [configured SQL review](/sql-review/review-policy). It will be automatically executed when you click **Create**, too.

1. Once you click **Create**, the plan will enter `Draft` status. You may still encounter warnings. Address these warnings first.

1. Click **Ready for Review** and the issue is ready for review.

## Approve the Issue

1. The issue will await approval. The approval process is automatically matched by the [custom approval](/change-database/approval).

1. Click **Approve** to authorize the plan by the designated approvers.

## Deploy the Issue

1. Once all approvals are secured, the rollout is ready to be executed.

1. Click **Run** to deploy the issue.

1. When all rollouts are successfully executed, the issue will be marked as `Done`.

## Summary

An issue lifecycle: Plan -> Review -> Approve -> Rollout.
