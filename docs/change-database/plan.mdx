title: Plan

A **Plan** is the core component of Bytebase’s CI/CD pipeline. It defines a series of schema or data changes to be applied to one or more databases. It can be converted into an **Issue** for review and deployment.

### 1. Create Plan

In your project, navigate to **CI/CD** > **Plans** and click **+ New Plan**.

### 2. Select Databases

Choose one or moretarget databases and click **Confirm**.

### 3. Add Changes

Add SQL statements (multiple allowed by clicking **+ Add Change**) and click **Create**. The plan will be in `Draft` status with automatic SQL review.

### 4. Submit for Review (Enterprise)

Fix the warning, and click **Ready for Review**. The plan will be converted into an issue and await approval. Approval follows [configured rules](/change-database/approval).
