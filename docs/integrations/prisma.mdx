[Prisma Postgres](https://www.prisma.io/postgres) is a fully managed serverless PostgreSQL that focuses on performance, with built-in connection pooling.

You can create a Prisma Postgres instance and use Bytebase to manage the database development lifecycle for those databases.

While Prisma Postgres already has developer-oriented features like branching, Bytebase adds extra value to offer a systematic database development and change workflow. This is especially useful for cross-functional teams requiring collaboration (e.g. having dedicated DBA or platform engineering team apart from the application development teams).

## Prerequisites

- [Sign up](https://console.prisma.io/) for Prisma Postgres, you can sign in with a Github Google account, or email and password.
- After signing in, you are directed to the Prisma Console where you can [set up your project](https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/).

## Procedure

### Step 1 - Set up project on Prisma Postgres and collect connection info

Once you have set up your project, click "Connect" button in the Connect Database card and copy the connection string that is generated for you.

With this connection string, we have the following information represented

```
postgresql://[username]:[password]@[host][:port]/[dbname][?param1=value1&param2=value2]
```

### Step 2 - Add Prisma Postgres instance to Bytebase

From your Bytebase **Create Instance** page, choose **Add Instance**, fill in the details to create the connection as follows:

1. **Database:** `PostgreSQL`.
2. **Instance Name:** any name of your choosing, e.g. `ppg-bb`.
3. **Environment:** `Prod` or `Test` (select the environment you want to add the instance to).
4. **Host or Socket:** the **host** section of the connection string: `db.prisma.io`
5. **Port:** 5432 (Prisma Postgres uses the default PostgreSQL port of 5432 to connect)
6. **Username:** copy the **username** section of the connection string
7. **Password:** copy the **password** section of the connection string
8. **Database:** copy the **dbname** section of the connection string: `postgres`

See [Add an Instance](/get-started/step-by-step/add-an-instance) for more details.

### Step 3 - Check if the database instance is properly imported

All databases should be synced properly. Expect some delay if the database instance is large.

So should the tables under the databases.
