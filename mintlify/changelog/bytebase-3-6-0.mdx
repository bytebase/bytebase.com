Bytebase has earned [SOC 2 Type 2 certification](https://www.bytebase.com/blog/soc2-type2/) building on our earlier [Type 1 certification](https://www.bytebase.com/blog/soc2-type1) acquisition.

## ðŸš€ New Features

- Add basic support for Trino database.

## ðŸ”” Breaking Changes

- API change:

  - Remove `EnvironmentService`. The environment setting now resides in `SettingService`. `bb.environments.*` permissions are removed from custom roles. You can grant `bb.settings.update` to a role to allow it to update the environment setting.

- Deprecate Anomaly Center. Schema drift is now visible in both the database list and on the database page.

## ðŸŽ„ Enhancements
