## 🐞 Important Bug Fixes

### MySQL 5.7 compatibility

In the previous version, Bytebase couldn't sync the migration history properly because it used a MySQL 8.0 only feature.

## 🚀 New Features

User can now configure weekly automatic backup for the database. Meanwhile, user can also take manual backup anytime. Later on, User can restore the backup to a new database.
