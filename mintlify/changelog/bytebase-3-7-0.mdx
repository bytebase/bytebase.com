## 🚀 New Features

- Support batch data export from limited databases in the SQL Editor.
- Support requesting any project roles.
- Support displaying `CHECK` constraints in the SQL Editor.
- **Trino** - Support data masking.
- **MariaDB** - Support sql_type in risk condition.
- **SQL Server** - Support columnstore index.

## 🔔 Breaking Changes

### 💰 Pricing

- **Custom approval** is no longer restricted by instance limits. It now only requires an **Enterprise subscription**. Previously, it was limited to licensed instances — now it applies to any instance under an Enterprise plan.

### 🎨 GUI

- Remove **Earliest allowed time**. Use **Scheduled time** during rollout instead.

- The **gh-ost** and **backup** toggles are now set at the issue level, no longer at the task level.

- The **SQL statement** is now defined at the issue level, no longer at the task level. Once a task has started or completed, the statement cannot be updated.

### 🧩 API

- Remove `earliest_allowed_time` from `Plan.spec`. Use `run_at` in `BatchRunTasksRequest` instead.

- Remove `steps` and `target` from `Plan`. Use `specs` and `targets` respectively.

- Remove `PreviewPlan` RPC from `PlanService`.

- Update `ChangeDatabaseConfig`:
  - Remove `BASELINE` from `Type`.
  - Remove `schema_version`.
  - Add `release`.

- Update setting names, use the correct values as defined in [SettingName](https://github.com/bytebase/bytebase/blob/d950ad46fa88d1ad40299a780b34bd0fa28adc3a/proto/v1/v1/setting_service.proto#L111).

## 🎄 Enhancements

- **PostgreSQL** - Issue tickets now honor any supplied `SET search_path`, so subsequent SQL statements (and their DML rollback logic) operate on the specified schema rather than defaulting to public.
- **Trino** - Enhance auto-completion support.
- **TiDB** - Improve syntax error detection.
- **TiDB** - The "require primary key" rule now checks the source table when using `CREATE TABLE LIKE`.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Doris** and **StarRocks** - Resolve compatibility issues.
- **RedShift** - Fix connection database parameter issue.
