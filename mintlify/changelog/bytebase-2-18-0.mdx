## 📰 Fresh Off the Press

- ⚙️ Automating databases can boost efficiency, minimize human mistakes, maintain uniformity, and allow database administrators and developers to concentrate on more strategic initiatives. 🚗 Inspired by the six levels of autonomous driving, we can outline the [six levels of database automation](/blog/database-automation-levels/).
- 🧑‍💻 As the engineering team grows and daily database operations become more complex, there is a pressing need for a centralized method to manage and enforce the change process. 🛠️ Implementing a tool such as Jira might be an effective immediate solution. However, [using Jira for database changes won't cut It](/blog/use-jira-for-database-change/).
