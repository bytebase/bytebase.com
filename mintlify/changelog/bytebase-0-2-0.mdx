## 🚀 New Features

- **Migration history** - Added the migration history to the database detail page. This is applicable to project using either UI or Version Control workflow.
- **Table detail page** - Added table detail page. This is normally reached via the database detail page. The table detail page displays the basic table info as well as its columns and indexes.

## 🎄 Experience Enhancement

- Added button to referesh the repository list when configuring the project Version Control workflow.
- Added help doc on [how to start a MySQL docker instance](https://docs.bytebase.com/install/docker#start-a-mysql-docker-instance-for-testing).

## 🎠 Community

- In the first week after we open sourced Bytebase on GitHub, we have added 3 external contributors. We also created and resolved the first issue. Thanks @silentred, @s7v7nislands, @spinningbot for the PR, as well as @IronManZ suggestions on how to improve the MySQL setup guide.
