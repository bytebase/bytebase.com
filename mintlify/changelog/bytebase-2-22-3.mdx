## ðŸš€ New Features

- [One-click rollback](/change-database/rollback-data-changes/#1-click-rollback) for PostgreSQL DML change.

## ðŸŽ„ Enhancements

- Enhance DML Backup and Restore Experience:
  - Guide users to create the `bbdataarchive` database. Prior backup cannot be enabled if this database doesn't exist.
  - Allow users to enable or disable the backup option after an issue is created.
  - For unsupported backup scenarios, an error will be reported when turning on the backup switch.
  - Support MySQL generated columns.
  - Bulk `UPDATE` statements to a single table will be backed up into a single table. Before, each `UPDATE` statement will be backed up into a separate table.
- Enhance SQL Editor sidebar:
  - Display column types and nullable information.
  - Show columns and dependent columns in views.
- Under the **Issued Created** tab, add an **All** sub-tab.
- Enable i18n support for auto-generated issue titles.
- Add a project setting to require manually entering issue titles instead of using Bytebaseâ€™s auto-generated titles.
