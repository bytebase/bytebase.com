## 🚀 New Features

## 🎄 Enhancement

- Searchable member selector.
- Database labels can be managed as normal properties. Database label related features are available for standard mode projects now.
- Show comprehensive schema comparison when schema drift is detected.
- Add quickstart for MySQL and Clickhouse.  You can choose to have MySQL or Clickhouse run automatically with Bytebase without additional installation. Thanks @showsmall  for [the suggestion](https://github.com/bytebase/bytebase/issues/403).
