## 🚀 Features

- Add [State-based GitOps workflow](/gitops/state-based-workflow/overview) for PostgreSQL.
- Add support for [IdP-initiated SSO flow](/administration/sso/idp-initiated).

## 🔔 Notable Changes

- Remove identity provider permissions from the Workspace DBA role.
- Remove support for URL-based secret retrieval via `URL` template format.
- Deprecate changelist feature.
- Add character length limits to prevent overly long entries and ensure data consistency. Length limits applied:
  - 200 characters: Titles and names (groups, issues, plans, projects, instances, users, etc.)
  - 1,000 characters: Short descriptions (group descriptions, operation reasons for cancel/skip/restart tasks)
  - 10,000 characters: Long descriptions (issue details, plan details)
  - 65,536 characters: Comments and long-form text (issue comments)
- Update `APP_IM` configuration format in API and UI.

    Before:
    ```json
    {
    "slack": {
        "enabled": true,
        "token": "xxx"
    },
    "lark": {
        "enabled": true,
        ...
    },
    "feishu": {
        "enabled": true,
        ...
    }
    }
    ```

    After:
    ```json
    {
    "settings": [
        {
        "type": "slack",
        "slack": {
            "token": "xxx"
        }
        },
        {
        "type": "lark",
        "lark": {}
        }
    ]
    }
    ```

## 🎄 Enhancements

- Issue comment editor now supports searching and linking to other issues within the same project.
- Support data export for multi-statement queries in SQL Editor.
- Enhance SSO state management to align with OAuth 2.0 best practices.
- Add 5-minute expiration for MFA temporary tokens.
- Clarify label types with explicit naming: Project Labels, Issue Labels, Database Labels.

## 🐞 Bug Fixes

- Fix the false positive `Primary Key missing` error during SQL Review when adding a PK in a separate statement for PostgreSQL.
