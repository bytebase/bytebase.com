title: Bytebase: The DevSecOps Control Plane for Your Databases
---

Bytebase is the DevSecOps platform that sits between your team and your databases. Built by the team that previously created Google's Cloud database and API infrastructure, it acts as a centralized control plane to deliver two critical outcomes for engineering leaders: **better security and compliance**, and **improved productivity and reliability**.

It‚Äôs a unified platform specifically built for your **developer, security, DBA, and platform engineering teams** to collaborate. Its value becomes particularly critical as your organization grows, reducing the friction of managing a large number of databases and instances. Bytebase achieves this by consolidating two distinct workflows.

## 1. For Productivity & Reliability: Managing Schema Changes at Scale üöÄ

This section covers how Bytebase makes all database changes safer and more efficient. By providing a structured process, it also enhances security by **eliminating the need for engineers to make direct changes against databases**. Bytebase supports two distinct workflows for schema changes:

**UI-driven Workflow**: Provides a complete, console-based process with built-in risk analysis and multi-step approvals, offering a secure and self-contained way to manage schema changes.

**GitOps Workflow (Database-as-Code)**: Features a full GitOps workflow that integrates with your provider (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps) and existing CI/CD pipelines, allowing developers to manage database migrations entirely as code.

In addition to these workflows, the platform provides overarching capabilities for reliability and scale:

**Fleet-wide Batch Changes**: Manage and apply schema changes across a collection of databases in a single, coordinated workflow, dramatically reducing manual effort.

**1-Click DML Rollback**: Provides streamlined, 1-click rollback for data changes (DML), allowing for instant recovery from unintended UPDATE or DELETE statements.

## 2. For Security & Compliance: Governing Data Access at Scale üõ°Ô∏è

This workflow governs how your database data is accessed, replacing the need for disparate SQL clients and shared credentials.

**Centralized Access Control:** Grant data query permissions based on role, not on sharing database passwords. This provides a single place to manage who can see what across your entire environment.

**Compliance & Data Security:** Enforce **dynamic data masking** to protect sensitive PII and maintain a complete audit log of every query for compliance with standards like GDPR and CCPA.

**Efficient Cross-Database Querying:** The web-based SQL Editor allows you to issue a **single query against multiple databases** simultaneously, ideal for analytics and operational oversight.

In short, Bytebase unifies the process of **changing the database** with the **process of accessing its data**, giving you a single pane of glass for true database DevSecOps.

## How Bytebase Compares: Schema Migration Tools

While Liquibase and Flyway are powerful command-line migration tools (think Git), Bytebase provides the complete platform experience (think GitHub/GitLab). It wraps these migration capabilities in a collaborative interface with approval workflows, audit trails, and enterprise controls. As the fastest-growing open source solution in this space, Bytebase has become the top choice for teams seeking a unified database DevSecOps platform.

## How Bytebase Compares: SQL Clients

Traditional SQL clients like DBeaver, DataGrip, and Navicat excel at individual database access but weren't built for team collaboration or enterprise security. Bytebase transforms SQL access from a personal tool into an enterprise-ready platform‚Äîproviding not just query capabilities, but also role-based permissions, data masking, audit logging, and centralized governance that eliminates the need to share database credentials.
