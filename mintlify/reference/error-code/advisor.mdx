## General

### 0 - OK

Success

### 1 - Internal error

Something unexpected happened, you can open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/bytebase/bytebase/issues) or [contact us](mailto:support-3fc2156a2150@intake.linear.app).

### 2 - Schema review policy not found

Cannot find the schema review policy in a specific environment. Please [follow the doc](/sql-review/review-policy/#create-schema-review-policy) to create the policy.

## Compatibility

### 101 - DROP DATABASE

Applications usually specifies database in their connection string. Dropping the database will definitely break those applications.

### 102 - RENAME TABLE

Renaming the table will break the code referring that table.

### 103 - DROP TABLE

Dropping the table will break the code referring that table.

### 104 - RENAME COLUMN

Renaming the column will break the code referring that column.

### 105 - DROP COLUMN

Dropping the column will break the code referring that column.

### 106 - ADD PRIMARY KEY

Primary key requires the candidate key set has unique value and the chosen candidate key set might not meet this requirement.

### 107 - ADD UNIQUE KEY

Unique key requires the candidate key set has unique value and the chosen candidate key set might not meet this requirement.

### 108 - ADD FOREIGN KEY

The existing values on the candidate foreign key and the referenced key might not meet the referential requirements.

### 109 - ADD CHECK

The existing value might not meet the check requirement.

### 110 - ALTER CHECK

The existing value might not meet the check requirement.

### 111 - ALTER COLUMN

Some ALTER COLUMN change is backward incompatible such as changing the data type from VARCHAR to INT. On the other hand, some change is backward compatible such as changing the database type from INT to BIGINT, or adding a comment and etc. User should review the actual statement.
