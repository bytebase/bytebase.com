<Warning>
**BEFORE YOU UPGRADE**

- Never run multiple containers on the same data directory. Stop and remove the old one first to avoid corruption.
- Back up your metadata before upgrading. Youâ€™ll need it if you ever downgrade.

</Warning>

## Upgrade Process

Take Docker as an example (**follow the below steps exactly**):

1. Stop Bytebase

   ```text
   docker stop bytebase
   docker rm bytebase
   ```

1. ðŸš¨ Back up the Bytebase metadata

   ```bash
   cp -rp ~/.bytebase/data ~/.bytebase/data.bak
   ```

   Above example backs up the metadata stored in the embedded database.
   If you store metadata in the [external PostgreSQL](/get-started/install/external-postgres/), you should
   back up that database.

1. Change version string to 3.8.0

1. Start Bytebase

   <TerminalDockerRunVolume />

## Version Management

Bytebase adopts [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) using the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

Bytebase ties the version number with the underlying database schema progression, because:

1. Schema change is a good approximate to the functional change. Large schema changes often indicate large functional changes.
1. Schema change determines the customer involvement when upgrading to the new version.

   - `MAJOR` version change usually happens once a year. It _might_ require manual effort from the customer. Bytebase will
     try to avoid that if possible.
   - `MINOR` version is changed when the underlying database schema changes. While the upgrade does not require customer involvement. `MINOR` version change usually happens about once every month.
   - `PATCH` version is changed when the new version does not include underlying database schema changes. `PATCH` version change usually happens bi-weekly following our release schedule.

## Docker Image Version

Certain changes maybe cherry-picked into the existing version. So when Bytebase starts next time, it will self-upgrade.
If you don't want this behavior, you could use the image digest to pin the exact commit. For example,

```bash
# https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/bytebase/bytebase/tags/3.7.0/sha256-29be3c651d4fc93c6aab37046b41128015a9be5d6f02b2490353962c469c5110
docker pull bytebase/bytebase:3.7.0@sha256:00b436855b08739aad02fd52e41b5d74c03db9c70c49ce5de42376347cd1403c
```

The docker image is built with [OpenContainers Annotations](https://specs.opencontainers.org/image-spec/annotations/):

```bash
docker inspect bytebase/bytebase:3.7.0 | jq -r '.[0].Config.Labels'
{
  "org.opencontainers.image.revision": "fb430b0626c33d3431e750dc0cc446f3c8a434a8",
  "org.opencontainers.image.version": "3.7.0"
}

# Digest also works
docker inspect bytebase/bytebase:3.7.0@sha256:00b436855b08739aad02fd52e41b5d74c03db9c70c49ce5de42376347cd1403c | jq -r '.[0].Config.Labels'
{
  "org.opencontainers.image.revision": "ec5d81d554287258095377c076528d8ab6664fa0",
  "org.opencontainers.image.version": "3.7.0"
}
```

- `org.opencontainers.image.revision` is the git commit hash, in the example, it corresponds to the [particular git commit](https://github.com/bytebase/bytebase/commit/fb430b0626c33d3431e750dc0cc446f3c8a434a8)
- `org.opencontainers.image.version` is the release version, in the example, it corresponds to the [3.7.0 release branch](https://github.com/bytebase/bytebase/commits/release/3.7.0).

If you want to check the commit history for the image, the best way is to visit the release branch page and locate the commit:

![release-commit](/content/docs/get-started/upgrade/release-commit.webp)

## Upgrade from Old Version

To upgrade, replace the version string with the target version and restart. Bytebase will self-upgrade automatically.

### Upgrade from 1.x or 2.x

First upgrade to 2.1.0 and then follow the next section.

### Upgrade from 3.0.0 ~ 3.3.0

First upgrade to 3.3.1 and then follow the next section.

### Upgrade from 3.3.1

Replace the version string with the latest version and restart.
