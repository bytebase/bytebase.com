<Warning>

Make sure to back up the metadata before upgrading. You need the old version metadata to downgrade if needed.

</Warning>

## Upgrade Process

Take Docker as an example:

1. Stop Bytebase

   ```text
   docker stop bytebase
   docker rm bytebase
   ```

1. ðŸš¨ Back up the Bytebase metadata

   ```bash
   cp -rp ~/.bytebase/data ~/.bytebase/data.bak
   ```

   Above example backs up the metadata stored in the embedded database.
   If you store metadata in the [external PostgreSQL](/get-started/install/external-postgres/), you should
   back up that database.

1. Change version string to 3.7.1
1. Start Bytebase

   <TerminalDockerRunVolume />

   <Note>

   Sometimes, we cherrypick the changes to the existing version. So when Bytebase starts next time, it will self-upgrade.
   If you want to disable this, you could use the digest to pin the exact commit. For example,
   [bytebase/bytebase:3.7.0@sha256:00b436855b08739aad02fd52e41b5d74c03db9c70c49ce5de42376347cd1403c](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/bytebase/bytebase/tags/3.7.0/sha256-29be3c651d4fc93c6aab37046b41128015a9be5d6f02b2490353962c469c5110).

   </Note>

## Version Management

Bytebase adopts [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) using the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

Bytebase ties the version number with the underlying database schema progression, because:

1. Schema change is a good approximate to the functional change. Large schema changes often indicate large functional changes.
1. Schema change determines the customer involvement when upgrading to the new version.

   - `MAJOR` version change usually happens once a year. It _might_ require manual effort from the customer. Bytebase will
     try to avoid that if possible.
   - `MINOR` version is changed when the underlying database schema changes. While the upgrade does not require customer involvement. `MINOR` version change usually happens about once every month.
   - `PATCH` version is changed when the new version does not include underlying database schema changes. `PATCH` version change usually happens bi-weekly following our release schedule.

### Upgrade from 3.3.1

Just replace the version string and restart. Bytebase will self-upgrade automatically.

### Upgrade from 3.0.0 ~ 3.3.0

First upgrade to 3.3.1 and then upgrade to the latest version.

### Upgrade from 1.x or 2.x

Please first upgrade to 2.1.0 and then upgrade to the latest version.
