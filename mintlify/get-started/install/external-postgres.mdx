title: Configure External PostgreSQL
---

import TerminalDockerRunExternalUrl from '/snippets/install/terminal-docker-run-external-url.mdx';

By default, Bytebase bundles an embedded PostgreSQL instance for storing its own metadata. The metadata is stored under the [--data](/reference/command-line#--data-directory) directory.

**For production setup, you should pass `PG_URL` environment variable to store these metadata in an external PostgreSQL database.**

## Postgres version

PostgreSQL 14 or above.

## Connection string format for PG_URL

**Supported format:**

_postgresql://\<\<user>>:\<\<secret>>@\<\<host>>:\<\<port>>/\<\<database>\>_

**Example:**

_postgresql://bytebase:z\*3kd2@example.com:5432/meta_

### Database

The connecting `database` must be created in advance. **The database should use UTF-8 for encoding. UTF-8 encoding is mandatory across the entire system**.

### User

<Note>

For Cloud Database such as AWS RDS, GCP Cloud SQL, ensure that the `user` either owns the schema (`public`) and `database`, or has the necessary privileges to access them.

- `ALTER DATABASE database OWNER TO bytebase;`
- `ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO bytebase;`

</Note>

The connecting `user` must have all the following database privileges:

- SELECT
- INSERT
- UPDATE
- DELETE
- TRUNCATE
- REFERENCES
- TRIGGER
- CREATE
- CONNECT
- TEMPORARY
- EXECUTE
- USAGE

### Host

If you **run Bytebase inside Docker** and want to connect the pg instance on the same host, then you need to use `host.docker.internal`.

## Docker example

This bash script demonstrates how to add an external PostgreSQL database as the metadata store when running the bytebase container.

<TerminalDockerRunExternalUrl />

## Troubleshoot

### Cannot new server ERROR: syntax error at or near xxx

Make sure that the connecting user is either superuser or is the owner of the connecting database. See [User](#user) and [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/bytebase/bytebase/discussions/14041).
