title: Configure External URL
---

<Warning>

You must configure the correct External URL otherwise following features won't work:

    - [GitOps](/vcs-integration/overview)
    - [SSO](/administration/sso/overview)
    - [SCIM](/administration/scim/overview)

You may also need to configure the additional GitOps Webhook URL if the public endpoint is different
than the internal one.

</Warning>

For testing purpose, you can get an endpoint online with [ngrok](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup/macos) as external URL.

When running Bytebase in production, you should not make the node that's running the Bytebase server directly accessible to the client. Instead, you should set up a gateway such as Nginx or Caddy to forward requests to Bytebase.

The gateway will expose an external endpoint that lets end users access the Bytebase console and allows external systems—such as VCS providers (GitHub or GitLab)—to call the Bytebase API.

<Note>

If the exposed port is not 80 or 443, please include the port number in External URL. e.g. Use http://bytebase.example.com:8080 instead of http://bytebase.example.com.

</Note>

## Configure via UI

1. Click **Settings** on the top bar.
1. Click **General** under **Workspace**, fill in the desired External URL and click **Update**.
1. GitOps Webhook URL can only be configured via UI. If not set, it will default to the same value as External URL.

## Pass `--external-url` when starting Bytebase

[`--external-url`](/reference/command-line#--external-url-string) can be passed when starting Bytebase.

<Note>

This will persist the External URL setting. Thus if Bytebase starts without specifying `--external-url`
next time, the previously passed External URL value will still be there.
