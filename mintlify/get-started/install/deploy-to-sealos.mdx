title: Deploy to sealos
---

If you run [Bytebase on Kubernetes](/docs/get-started/self-host/#kubernetes), you need to prepare a Kubernetes cluster, PostgreSQL instance, storage driver, and ingress for external access.

Alternatively, you can use [sealos Cloud](https://cloud.sealos.io/), which provides these dependencies out-of-the-box.

## Prerequisites

A sealos Cloud account (free signup).

## Deploy

1. Click the following button:

   [![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/labring-actions/templates/main/Deploy-on-Sealos.svg)](https://cloud.sealos.io/?openapp=system-template%3FtemplateName%3Dbytebase)

1. Click "Deploy Application" on the template page to start deployment.
1. Once deployment concludes, click "Details" to navigate to the application's details.
1. Wait for the application's status to running. Then click on the external link to open the Bytebase's web interface directly through the external domain.
