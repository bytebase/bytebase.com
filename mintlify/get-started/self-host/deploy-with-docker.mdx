import TerminalDockerRunVolume from '/snippets/install/terminal-docker-run-volume.mdx';

## Installation

<TerminalDockerRunVolume />

Bytebase is now accessible at http://localhost:8080.

## Production Setup

For production deployments:

1. Review [System Requirements](/faq#system-requirements) to ensure adequate resources.
2. Configure [External PostgreSQL](/get-started/self-host/external-postgres/) for production deployments.
3. Configure [HTTPS and WebSocket](/get-started/external-access) in your gateway (e.g., Nginx) for secure connections.
4. See the complete [Production Setup Guide](/get-started/production-setup/) for additional recommendations.

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Compatibility

Docker version must be at least 20.10.24. We recommend using the [latest Docker version](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). If you cannot upgrade Docker, pass `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined` to `docker run` as a best effort to avoid the `pthread_create failed` error.

If you encounter a "manifest not found" error, this may be due to:
- **Architecture mismatch**: The docker image only supports `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` architectures. If it doesn't match your OS architecture, you may supply `--platform linux/amd64` as a best effort.
- **Outdated Docker version**: Your Docker version is too old and doesn't support manifest lists.

### Air-gapped Environment

If you need to transfer images to a completely air-gapped environment:

```bash
# Save the image to a tar file
docker save bytebase/bytebase:latest > bytebase-latest.tar

# Transfer the tar file to your target environment
# Then load it on the target system
docker load < bytebase-latest.tar

# Tag and push as described above
docker tag bytebase/bytebase:latest your-registry.acme.com/library/bytebase:latest
docker push your-registry.acme.com/library/bytebase:latest
```

### Port Conflicts

If you see `bind: address already in use` error, it means the port 8080 is already in use on your host. You need to either stop the existing process using the port or configure Bytebase to use a different port via `--publish <<YOUR_PORT>>:8080`.

### Connect to Database on Same Host

- If you **run Bytebase inside Docker on Linux**, then you need to supply the additional `--network host` flags in `docker run` command. This allows Bytebase to connect to database instance running on the same host with `localhost`.
- If you **run Bytebase inside Docker Desktop on Mac** , then you need to use `host.docker.internal` to connect to database instance running on the same host.

### Colima Support

Due to the vm mechanism of [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima), try to use the `--mount` option when starting colima as shown below:

```text
mkdir ~/volumes
colima start --mount ~/volumes:w
docker run --init \
  --name bytebase \
  --restart always \
  --publish 80:8080 --pull always \
  --volume ~/.bytebase/data:/var/opt/bytebase bytebase/bytebase:latest \
  --data /var/opt/bytebase \
  --external-url http://bytebase.example.com \
  --port 8080
```

### Advanced Options

For more control over the server configuration, see [Server Startup Options](/reference/command-line).

### China Access

If accessing from China, use the mirror image:

```bash
docker run --rm --init \
  --name bytebase \
  --publish 8080:8080 --pull always \
  --volume ~/.bytebase/data:/var/opt/bytebase \
  registry.cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/bytebase/bytebase:latest
```
