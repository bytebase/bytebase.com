This page describes how to set up Bytebase in production environment.

## System Requirements

### CPU and RAM

| Usage                           | Bytebase                  | [External PostgreSQL](/get-started/self-host/external-postgres/) if used |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5 users and 5 instances         | 1 CPU cores and 2 GB RAM  | 1 CPU cores and 2 GB RAM                                               |
| 20 users and 20 instances       | 2 CPU cores and 4 GB RAM  | 1 CPU cores and 2 GB RAM                                               |
| 50 users and 50 instances       | 4 CPU cores and 8 GB RAM  | 2 CPU cores and 4 GB RAM                                               |
| Above 250 users or 50 instances | 8 CPU cores and 16 GB RAM | 2 CPU cores and 4 GB RAM                                               |

### Storage

Bytebase uses a PostgreSQL database to store SQL statements and other metadata. 

- If using cloud services (RDS, Cloud SQL) that support disk expansion, you can start with 20 GB and increase the size later as usage grows
- Otherwise, start with 100 GB to avoid running out of space

Teams that frequently work with large SQL files may need more.

## Enable HTTPS and WebSocket

You can use [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/reverse-proxy) or [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/). Check out the [configuration example](/get-started/self-host/external-access).

## Configure External URL

See [Configure External URL](/get-started/self-host/external-url).

## Store metadata in External PostgreSQL

See [Configure External PostgreSQL](/get-started/self-host/external-postgres).

## Telemetry

Access telemetry at `/metrics` (e.g. https://demo.bytebase.com/metrics).

## High Availability (HA)

You can only run a single Bytebase workspace at a time. In other words, you can scale up the workspace but cannot scale it out to multiple replicas.

Restarting the Bytebase workspace usually takes under 10 seconds. To minimize the downtime, you should
store the metadata in an [external PostgreSQL database](#store-metadata-in-external-postgresql) and make sure the PostgreSQL instance is highly available.

## Kubernetes

### Set `replicas: 1`

Make sure to set the replicas to **1**, otherwise, it may cause data race issues.

### Stateless Architecture

Bytebase is now stateless and does not require persistent volumes. All metadata should be stored in an [external PostgreSQL database](/get-started/self-host/external-postgres).

## Docker Image Versioning

For production deployments, pin to a specific version (e.g., `bytebase/bytebase:3.9.0`) instead of using `latest` to prevent unexpected updates.

See the latest versions in our [changelog](https://docs.bytebase.com/changelog).

## Cloud vendor stack

If you self-host Bytebase in the cloud provider, below is the recommended stack.

### AWS

- EC2 + RDS for PostgreSQL.
- ECS/EKS + RDS for PostgreSQL.

### GCP

- GCE + Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL.
- GKE + Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL.
