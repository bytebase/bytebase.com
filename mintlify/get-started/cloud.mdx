<Note>

For teams with security/compliance requirements, please [self host Bytebase](/get-started/self-host) (don't be scared, it's a single binary and deployment is easy).

</Note>

[Bytebase Cloud](https://hub.bytebase.com/) is hosted on Google Cloud GKE us-central region. With Bytebase Cloud, you can provision your Bytebase instance instantly.

## Provision a Bytebase instance

## Log in to the workspace

2. Fill in the **Email** and **Password**, and click **Sign in**.
3. A sample PostgreSQL instance is already available.

## Add additional member

Because Bytebase Cloud disables self-signup, so the `Workspace Admin` needs to add new members manually.

Then set a temporary password and tell the user offline to let her sign-in.
