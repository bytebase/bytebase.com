2. Fill in the **Email** and **Password**, and click **Sign in**.
3. A sample PostgreSQL instance is already available.

## Add additional member

Because Bytebase Cloud disables self-signup, so the `Workspace Admin` needs to add new members manually.

Then set a temporary password and tell the user offline to let them sign-in.
