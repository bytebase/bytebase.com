It's recommended to [run Bytebase with Docker](/get-started/deploy-with-docker) which is the easiest way to get you started.

Run the following command to start Bytebase on container port `8080` and map it to localhost port `8080`.

<TerminalDockerRunVolume />

Visit Bytebase at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).

<Tip>

If you've run Bytebase before, you can reset all data by running this command:

```text
rm -rf ~/.bytebase/data
```
