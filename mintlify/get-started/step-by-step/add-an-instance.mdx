title: 'Step 4: Add an Instance'
---

**Database Instance** or simply **Instance** models after a single database server accessed via a host:port address or a primary/replica cluster. A typical database instance could be your on-premises MySQL instance, a PostgreSQL cluster, an AWS RDS instance etc. Each **Database Instance** belongs to an **Environment**.

## Prerequisites

- **Workspace Admin** or **Workspace DBA** role

## Add instance

<Info>

If you choose to use sample data during onboarding, Bytebase will start two embedded sample PostgreSQL instances accessible from `/tmp:8083` and `/tmp:8084`.

Go to **Instances** and **Add Instance**.

For **Host or socket**, the screenshot assumes you run Bytebase inside Docker and try to connect to a database instance on the same host, thus it uses `host.docker.internal`. Check out [Instance Connection Configuration](/get-started/instance) for the detailed guide.

## Sync instance schema

After instance is added, click **Sync Now** to synchronize the instance schema such as its containing databases to Bytebase.

![bb-instance-sync](/content/docs/get-started/step-by-step/add-an-instance/bb-instance-sync.webp)

By default, Bytebase doesn't automatically sync the instance schema. You can set a [Scan Interval](/administration/instance/#scan-interval) to ask Bytebase to sync the schema periodically.
