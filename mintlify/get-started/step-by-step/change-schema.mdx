title: 'Step 6: Change Schema'

**Issue** serves as the starting point for managing database changes, including `Schema Change (DDL)` and `Data Change (DML)`. These changes follow a structured workflow: **Plan**, **Review**, **Approve**, and **Rollout**. For actions like `Database Creation`, the workflow might be simpler, omitting some steps.

## Initiate an Issue with a Plan

1. Navigate to **CI/CD** > **Plans** in your project menu and click **+ New Plan**.

    ![new-plan](/content/docs/change-database/plan/bb-new-plan.webp)

1. Choose either **Schema Migration (DDL)** or **Data Migration (DML)**. In this example, we select **Schema Migration (DDL)**. After adding the first change, you can continue to add more changes within the same plan.

1. Select one or more databases where the changes will be applied. Click **Confirm** to proceed.

    ![plan-targets](/content/docs/change-database/plan/bb-plan-targets.webp)

1. If only **one** database is selected, you can use the **Schema Editor** to visually design the schema.

## Review the Issue

1. After clicking **Confirm**, you will be directed to the **Plan** page. Before clicking **Create**, you may choose to **Run checks** to execute the [configured SQL review](/sql-review/overview).

1. Once you click **Create**, the plan will enter `Draft` status. You may still encounter warnings. Address these warnings first.

    ![plan-draft-passed](/content/docs/get-started/step-by-step/change-schema/bb-plan-draft-passed.webp)

1. Click **Ready for Review** and then click **Confirm**.

## Approve the Issue

1. The issue will await approval. The approval process is automatically matched by the [custom approval](/change-database/approval).

    ![issue-to-approve](/content/docs/get-started/step-by-step/change-schema/bb-issue-to-approve.webp)

1. Click **Approve** to authorize the plan by the designated approvers.

## Deploy the Issue

1. Once all approvals are secured, the rollout is ready to be executed.

    ![issue-to-rollout](/content/docs/get-started/step-by-step/change-schema/bb-issue-to-rollout.webp)

1. Click **Run** to deploy the issue.

    ![run-rollout](/content/docs/get-started/step-by-step/change-schema/bb-run-rollout.webp)

1. When all rollouts are successfully executed, the issue will be marked as `Done`.

    ![issue-done](/content/docs/get-started/step-by-step/change-schema/bb-issue-done.webp)
