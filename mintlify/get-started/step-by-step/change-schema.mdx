title: Make a Database Schema Change
---

**Issue** drives the database change workflow such as `Schema Change (DDL)`, `Data Change (DML)`, and `Database Creation`. It's similar to the issue concept in other issue management tools.

## Create issue

Go to your project page, choose one or several databases to **Edit Schema**.

You may use the **Schema Editor** to visually design the schema.

Alternatively, you can switch to the **Raw SQL** mode. You can sync the raw SQL from the schema editor or supply your own
SQL statements.

Once you finish writing the SQL, click **Preview issue**.

By default, Bytebase will create a **Rollout issue**. You can check **SQL Review Only** to create a review-only plan.

## Review issue

If there's a [SQL review](/docs/sql-review/overview) warning, you may need to fix it first.

An issue may also require one or multiple manual approvals.

## Roll out issue

Once all approvals are granted, the issue can be rolled out.

## Summary

An issue lifecycle: Create -> Review -> Approve -> Roll out.
