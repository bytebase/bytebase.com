title: Create a Project
---

**Project** is a logic unit to model a team effort. It's similar to the project concept in other dev tools such as Jira, GitLab. **Project** is the container to group logically related **Databases**, **Issues** and **Users** together.

In Bytebase, A **Database** or an **Issue** always belongs to a single **Project**.

Make sure you have configured environments, instances, and members properly at the workspace level.

## Create project

Go to **Projects** and click **New Project**.

## Transfer a database into the project

<HintBlock type="info">

To make changes to a database, you need to place it in a project first.

</HintBlock>

Once a project is created, you need to fill it with some Databases. Go to the project page where you can **create a new database** or **transfer an existing database into the project**.

## Manage the members in the project

<HintBlock type="info">

To manage fine-grained database access, check out [Database Permission](/docs/security/database-permission/overview/).

</HintBlock>

A project is only visible to its related **users**. The project creator assumes `Project Owner`role and can manage project members.

Go to the project page. Click **Manage** > **Members** on the left sidebar. **Grant Access** to add new project members from workspace level accounts. You can assign project-level roles to the members.
