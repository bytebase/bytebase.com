After deploying Bytebase successfully, you need to register accounts for your team members.

## Create the first admin account

The first registered account is the admin account and will be granted a **Workspace Admin** role.
All following registered accounts will be regular accounts.

You will be promoted to choose the [Database Change Mode](/docs/administration/mode). Keep the default
and you can always change it later.

Bytebase also supports [SSO](/docs/administration/sso/overview) and [SCIM (Directory Sync)](/docs/administration/scim/overview).

As a **Workspace Admin**, you can manage all users in **Users & Groups** under **Security & Policy** section. You can **Add User** on the upper-right, or click the pencil icon to update user information like email.
