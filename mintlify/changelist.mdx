title: Changelist

Changelist allows you to stage a set of ordered changes. Then at a later time, you can repeatedly apply them
to the databases or export them as zip files to apply the changes offline.

You access Changelist from the Change Center:

![Change Center](/content/docs/changelist/bb-change-center.webp)

## Change sources

A particular change can come from the following sources:

### Change History

The [change history](/docs/change-database/change-workflow/#migration-history) already executed on the database.

### Raw SQL

Arbitrary SQL statements.

![bb-changelist-add-raw-sql](/content/docs/changelist/bb-changelist-add-raw-sql.webp)

## Manage changes

After adding changes, you may:

- Reorder them.

  ![bb-changelist-reorder](/content/docs/changelist/bb-changelist-reorder.webp)

- Apply them in bulk to databases in one issue.

  ![bb-changelist-apply](/content/docs/changelist/bb-changelist-apply.webp)

- Export them as a zip file. Each change corresponds to a separate change file. The file name is
  prefixed with the order number.

  ![bb-changelist-export](/content/docs/changelist/bb-changelist-export.webp)
