title: Terraform Provider
---

<Note>

The Bytebase Provider itself is free to use. Some advanced resource operations require Pro or Enterprise Plan.

Bytebase Terraform Provider handles control plane configuration such as settings, policies, access controls.
It does not handle data plane operations such as database creation, schema migrations, DML execution, query.

</Note>

Bytebase provides the [Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/bytebase/bytebase) to let you manage your Bytebase resources via Terraform.

```plain
Terraform Provider → Bytebase Configuration
                      ├── Instances, Projects & Environments
                      ├── Access Policies
                      └── Settings such as Approval Workflows

Bytebase UI/API → Database Operations
                   ├── Database Creation
                   ├── Schema Migrations (DDL)
                   ├── Data Changes (DML)
                   └── Query
```

## Create Service Account

The Terraform Provider uses [service account](/integrations/api/authentication/#service-account) to call the Bytebase API to manage the resources and settings.

After creating the service account, you can copy the service key as `service_key` and the email as `service_account` to initialize the Terraform provider in the next step.

## Troubleshoot

### status: 404

This often happens when someone deletes the resources from the Bytebase UI and then attempts to
run `terraform apply`.

To recover, please run `terraform refresh` to refresh the state first.
