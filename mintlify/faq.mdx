#### CPU and RAM

| Usage                           | Bytebase                  | [External PostgreSQL](/get-started/self-host/external-postgres/) if used |

| 5 users and 5 instances         | 1 CPU cores and 2 GB RAM  | 1 CPU cores and 2 GB RAM                                               |
| 20 users and 20 instances       | 2 CPU cores and 4 GB RAM  | 1 CPU cores and 2 GB RAM                                               |

| Above 250 users or 50 instances | 8 CPU cores and 16 GB RAM | 2 CPU cores and 4 GB RAM                                               |

#### Storage

Bytebase stores the SQL statements. If your team submits large SQL statements frequently,
then you need to reserve large disk space. A good starting point is to reserve 100 GB for where
the Bytebase server runs. And if you use [External PostgreSQL](/get-started/self-host/external-postgres/),
then you need to make sure to reserve enough space there.


## Does Bytebase retain your data

Bytebase does not retain any database row data.
