---

This tutorial will guide you to use [Terraform Bytebase Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/bytebase/bytebase/latest/docs) to manage your databases via [Terraform](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform).

Terraform is an **infrastructure as code** tool that lets you build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently. This includes low-level components like compute instances, storage, and networking; and high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.

[Bytebase](https://bytebase.com) is an open-source **database DevOps tool**, it's the GitLab for managing databases throughout the application development lifecycle. It offers a web-based workspace for Developers and DBAs to collaborate and manage the database change safely and efficiently.

Why Terraform? Although Bytebase provides a GUI for you to manage databases, if you have tens or hundreds of database instances for different environments, instead of repetitive and error-prone manual work, Terraform would definitely save your efforts and prevent mistakes.

You can find the complete Terraform code example on [GitHub](https://github.com/bytebase/terraform-provider-bytebase/tree/main/examples). This tutorial will help you get started with Bytebase and Terraform.

## Prerequisites

- Have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

## Install Terraform

Follow [Terraform installation Guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli), we use the mac version in this tutorial.

1. Install the HashiCorp tap, a repository of all our Homebrew packages.

   ```text
   brew tap hashicorp/tap
   ```

1. Install Terraform with hashicorp/tap/terraform.

   ```text
   brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform
   ```

1. Verify the installation by typing.

   ```text
   terraform -help
   ```

## Run Bytebase

1. Make sure your docker daemon is running, and then start the Bytebase docker container by typing the following command in the terminal.

   <IncludeBlock url="/docs/get-started/install/terminal-docker-run-volume"></IncludeBlock>

1. Type the following commands one by one in the terminal to start two MySQL instances, and they will be mapped to `Test` and `Prod` environments later.

   ```text
   docker run --name mysqldtest \
   -p 3307:3306 \
   -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=testpwd1 \
   -d mysql:8.0
   ```

   ```text
   docker run --name mysqldtest \
   -p 3308:3306 \
   -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=testpwd1 \
   -d mysql:8.0
   ```

1. Register an admin account which will be granted `Workspace Admin` role.
   ![register-admin](/content/docs/tutorials/manage-databases-in-bytebase-with-terraform/register-admin.webp)

## Add an Instance in Bytebase from GUI

In this section, you'll add an instance in Bytebase.

1. Login as admin, click **Instances** on the left sidebar, and click **+ Add Instance** on the top right.

1. Create an instance for `Test` Environment with the following configuration. Fill **username**/**password** as `root`/`testpwd1`
   ![bb-add-instance](/content/docs/tutorials/manage-databases-in-bytebase-with-terraform/bb-add-instance.webp)

1. Click **Projects** on the left sidebar, and click **+ New Project** on the top right. Create a project `Test` and click **Create**.

1. Go into `Test` project, click **Database >Databases** on the left sidebar, and click **+ New DB** on the top right.

1. Create a database `demo`, and click **Create**. This will take you to the issue page, an issue is created.

   ![bb-db-issue-demo-done](/content/docs/tutorials/manage-databases-in-bytebase-with-terraform/bb-db-issue-demo-done.webp)

## Add Instances via Terraform

You’ve added an instance for the `Test` environment in Bytebase by clicking. What if you need to add hundreds of instances. In this section, you’ll witness the process simplification Terraform brings.

### Step 1 - Create a Terraform file

1. Create a new folder `learn-terraform-bytebase` and create a blank file `main.tf` in it.
1. Go to [https://registry.terraform.io/providers/bytebase/bytebase/latest/docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/bytebase/bytebase/latest/docs). Click **Use Provider**, copy and paste the whole code block in the gray box into `main.tf`. Pay attention to the **version**.
   ![tf-use-provider](/content/docs/tutorials/manage-databases-in-bytebase-with-terraform/tf-use-provider.webp)

1. Follow the [example configuration](https://github.com/bytebase/terraform-provider-bytebase/blob/main/examples/setup/main.tf), copy the following provider part and paste it in `main.tf`.

   ```other
   provider "bytebase" {
   service_account = "<Your Bytebase service account email>"
   service_key     = "<Your Bytebase service account key>"
   url             = "<Your Bytebase external URL>"
   }
   ```

### Step 2 - Add a Terraform account

1. Go to **IAM & Admin > Users & Groups**, click **+ Add User**.

1. Choose `Service Account` as the **Type**, fill in the **Email** with `tf@service.bytebase.com`, choose `Workspace DBA` as **Roles**, and click **Confirm**.

1. Copy the **Service Key** for later use.

### Step 3 - Query to list all resources

1. Paste the **Service Key**, **Service Account Email**, and **URL** into `main.tf`.

1. Paste the following queries after the **provider** block and save the file. What it does is to list all existing environments and instances and print those out in the terminal.

   ```other
   # List all environment
   data "bytebase_environment_list" "all" {}
   output "all_environments" {
   value = data.bytebase_environment_list.all
   }

   # List all instances
   data "bytebase_instance_list" "all" {}
   output "all_instances" {
   value = data.bytebase_instance_list.all
   }
   ```

1. Run `terraform init`, `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` one by one in the terminal. You’ll see the output like this:

   ```other
   all_environments = {
      [
          {
              environment_tier_policy = "UNPROTECTED"
              name                    = "environments/test"
              order                   = 0
              resource_id             = "test"
              title                   = "Test"
            },
          {
              environment_tier_policy = "UNPROTECTED"
              name                    = "environments/prod"
              order                   = 1
              resource_id             = "prod"
              title                   = "Prod"
            },
        ]
        id = "xxxx"
        show_deleted = false
   }
   ```

   As we have two default environments in our Bytebase. Pay attention to `resource_id`, they are `test` and `prod` .
      ![bb-environments](/content/docs/tutorials/manage-databases-in-bytebase-with-terraform/bb-environments.webp)

   ```other
   all_instances = {
   "id" = "1744624330"
   "instances" = tolist([
      {
         "activation" = false
         "data_sources" = toset([
         {
            "database" = ""
            "external_secret" = tolist([])
            "host" = "host.docker.internal"
            "id" = "bb67b4b8-40c6-4ac6-a170-5f673183c759"
            "password" = ""
            "port" = "3307"
            "ssl_ca" = ""
            "ssl_cert" = ""
            "ssl_key" = ""
            "type" = "ADMIN"
            "username" = "root"
         },
         ])
         "engine" = "MYSQL"
         "engine_version" = "8.0.36"
         "environment" = "environments/test"
         "external_link" = ""
         "maximum_connections" = 0
         "name" = "instances/mysql-test"
         "resource_id" = "mysql-test"
         "sync_interval" = 0
         "title" = "MySQL test"
      },
      ...
   ])
   "show_deleted" = false
   }
   ```

   As we can see, it’s the instance we just added. Follow `"title" = "MySQL test"`, you'll find `"resource_id" = "mysql-test"`.

### Step 4 - Add instances via Terraform

Now you have listed all environments and instances you have in Bytebase. Then how to create/update?

1. Remove the `#List all environment` and `#List all environment` blocks, and add the following:

   ```other

   # Create a new environment named "Test"
   resource "bytebase_environment" "test" {
   resource_id             = "test"
   title                   = "Test"
   order                   = 0
   environment_tier_policy = "UNPROTECTED"
   }

   # Create another environment named "Prod"
   resource "bytebase_environment" "prod" {
   resource_id             = "prod"
   title                   = "Prod"
   order                   = 1
   environment_tier_policy = "UNPROTECTED"
   }

   resource "bytebase_instance" "test" {
   depends_on = [
      bytebase_environment.test
   ]
   resource_id = "mysql-test"
   environment = bytebase_environment.test.name
   title       = "MySQL test"
   engine      = "MYSQL"
   activation  = false

   # You need to specific the data source
   data_sources {
      id       = "admin data source mysql-test"
      type     = "ADMIN"
      host     = "host.docker.internal"
      port     = "3307"
      username = "root"
      password = "testpwd1"
   }
   }

   resource "bytebase_instance" "prod" {
   depends_on = [
      bytebase_environment.prod
   ]
   resource_id = "mysql-prod"
   environment = bytebase_environment.prod.name
   title       = "MySQL prod"
   engine      = "MYSQL"
   activation  = false

   # You need to specific the data source
   data_sources {
      id       = "admin data source mysql-prod"
      type     = "ADMIN"
      host     = "host.docker.internal"
      port     = "3308"
      username = "root"
      password = "testpwd1"
   }
   }

   ```

   What it does is first to define some variables, and then add four resources:

   - two environments – `Test` and `Prod`
   - two instances - `MySQL test` and `MySQL prod`

1. Run `terraform init`, `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` one by one in the terminal. You will see this in the terminal.

1. Go back to Bytebase, and click **Environments**. There is nothing changed with these two environments.

1. Click **Instances** on the left sidebar, and you will see the two instances we just added.

   ![bb-instances-2-added](/content/docs/tutorials/manage-databases-in-bytebase-with-terraform/bb-instances-2-added.webp)

1. Click into one instance, scroll down and click **Test Connection**. It should be successful.

## Things to Pay Attention To

Operations in Bytebase that rely on issues are not supported by Terraform. This includes:

- Create a database
- Executing DDL/DML statements

## Summary and Next

Now you have learned how to use Terraform to manage your MySQL database environments and instances in Bytebase, for PostgreSQL, you can futher declare database roles. Please check more [example usage in GitHub](https://github.com/bytebase/terraform-provider-bytebase/tree/main/examples).
