This tutorial series uses separate Terraform files for better organization. Files are numbered by tutorial part and sub-step (e.g., `1-1-env-setting.tf`, `1-2-env-policy-rollout.tf` for Part 1, `2-instances.tf` for Part 2, etc.). Terraform automatically handles dependencies between files.

## What You'll Learn

- **Configure** workspace profile settings including signup controls and external URL
- **Define** risk policies to trigger appropriate approval workflows
- **Create** multi-step approval flows for database changes

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:

- Completed [Part 3: Manage Projects with Terraform](/tutorials/manage-projects-in-bytebase-with-terraform)
- Bytebase running with service account configured
- Your Terraform files from the previous tutorials

## Setup

From the previous tutorials, you should have:

- Bytebase instances and projects configured
- Service account with Workspace Admin role
- Your Terraform files ready for additional configurations

## Configure Bytebase Settings

### Step 1 - Workspace Profile Configuration

Create `4-1-workspace-profile.tf` with the workspace profile settings:

```hcl
# Step 1: Workspace profile configuration
resource "bytebase_setting" "workspace_profile" {
  name = "settings/WORKSPACE_PROFILE"

  workspace_profile {
    disallow_signup          = true
    domains                  = ["example.com"]
    enforce_identity_domain  = false
    external_url             = "https://your-bytebase-url.com"
  }
}
```

This configuration:

- Disables public signup for security
- Restricts users to specific email domains
- Sets your Bytebase instance's external URL

### Step 2 - Risk Management Policies

Create `4-2-risk.tf` with risk policies that determine when approval flows are triggered:

```hcl
# Step 2: Risk management policies
resource "bytebase_risk" "dml_moderate" {
  title     = "DML Moderate Risk"
  source    = "DML"
  level     = 200
  active    = true
  condition = "environment_id == \"prod\" && affected_rows >= 100"
}

resource "bytebase_risk" "ddl_high" {
  title     = "DDL High Risk"
  source    = "DDL"
  level     = 300
  active    = true
  condition = "environment_id == \"prod\""
}
```

Risk levels:

- **200 (MODERATE)**: DML operations in production affecting 100+ rows
- **300 (HIGH)**: All DDL operations in production

### Step 3 - Approval Flow Settings

Create `4-3-approval-flow.tf` with approval flow configuration that requires multiple approvals for risky operations:

```hcl
# Step 3: Approval flow settings
resource "bytebase_setting" "approval_flow" {
  name = "settings/WORKSPACE_APPROVAL"

  approval_flow {
    rules {
      flow {
        title       = "Project Owner â†’ DBA â†’ Admin"
        description = "Need DBA and workspace admin approval"

        steps { role = "roles/projectOwner" }
        steps { role = "roles/workspaceDBA" }
        steps { role = "roles/workspaceAdmin" }
      }
      conditions {
        source = "DML"
        level  = "MODERATE"
      }
      conditions {
        source = "DDL"
        level  = "HIGH"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This creates a three-step approval flow that triggers for:

- DML operations with MODERATE risk level
- DDL operations with HIGH risk level

### Step 4 - Apply Configuration

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Step 5 - Verify in Bytebase

1. Go to **Settings > General** to verify workspace profile settings.
1. Go to **CI/CD > Custom Approval** to see the approval flow.

1. Go to **CI/CD > Risk Center** to view risk policies.

   ![risks](/content/docs/tutorials/manage-bytebase-settings-with-terraform/bb-risks.webp)

1. Go into `Project Two`, click **Database > Databases** on the left sidebar. Check `hr_prod`, click **Edit Schema**, add a new table `t0`. After creating the issue, corresponding risk `DDL high` and approval flow `Project Owner â†’ DBA â†’ Admin` will be matched.

## Key Points

- **Workspace Profile**: Controls signup, domain restrictions, and external URL
- **Risk Policies**: Automatically assess operations and trigger appropriate workflows
- **Approval Flows**: Define multi-step approval processes for risky operations
- You can configure additional [settings](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/bytebase/bytebase/latest/docs/resources/setting) such as classification and semantic_types. These will be covered in upcoming tutorials

## Next Steps

**Continue the series:** [Manage SQL Review Rules with Terraform](/tutorials/manage-sql-review-rules-with-terraform) - set up SQL review policies.
