## What You'll Learn

Register database instances in Bytebase using Terraform.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:

- **Completed [Part 1](/tutorials/manage-environments-with-terraform)**:
  - Bytebase running with built-in sample data
  - Service account created1
  - Terraform initialized
  - Environments configured

## Step 1 - Explore Built-in Instances

Bytebase sample data includes two sample PostgreSQL instances. Let's explore them:

1. In Bytebase, click **Instances** on the left sidebar. You'll see two PostgreSQL instances:

   - **Test Sample Instance** (port 8083)
   - **Prod Sample Instance** (port 8084)

2. Click **+Add Instance**, you may add more database instances.

   ![add-instance](/content/docs/tutorials/manage-databases-with-terraform/bb-add-instance.webp)

3. Click **Projects** on the left sidebar to see the `Sample Project`, then click it. You'll see:

   - `hr_test` database on Test instance
   - `hr_prod` database on Prod instance

4. Click **+ New DB**, you may create more databases on the existing instances.

   ![add-db](/content/docs/tutorials/manage-databases-with-terraform/bb-add-db.webp)

## Step 2 - Register Instances with Terraform

Now let's import these instances into Terraform management.

|                       |                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Terraform resource    | [bytebase_instance](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/bytebase/bytebase/latest/docs/resources/instance)         |
| Sample file           | [2-instances.tf](https://github.com/bytebase/terraform-provider-bytebase/blob/main/tutorials/2-instances.tf)          |

Create `2-instances.tf` with the following configuration:

```hcl 2-instances.tf
# Test Sample Instance - PostgreSQL on port 8083
resource "bytebase_instance" "test" {
  depends_on  = [bytebase_setting.environments]
  resource_id = "test-sample-instance"
  environment = "environments/test"
  title       = "Test Sample Instance"
  engine      = "POSTGRES"
  # Assign instance license
  activation  = true

  # Connection settings for the built-in test database
  data_sources {
    id       = "admin-test"
    type     = "ADMIN"
    host     = "/tmp"      # Unix socket for local connection
    port     = "8083"
    username = "bbsample"
    password = ""          # Empty for local auth
  }
}

# Production Sample Instance - PostgreSQL on port 8084
resource "bytebase_instance" "prod" {
  depends_on  = [bytebase_setting.environments]
  resource_id = "prod-sample-instance"
  environment = "environments/prod"
  title       = "Prod Sample Instance"
  engine      = "POSTGRES"
  activation  = true

  data_sources {
    id       = "admin-prod"
    type     = "ADMIN"
    host     = "/tmp"
    port     = "8084"
    username = "bbsample"
    password = ""
  }
}
```

**Understanding the Configuration**

- **depends_on**: Ensures environments from Part 1 exist first
- **resource_id**: Must match the existing instance ID
- **environment**: Links instance to Test or Prod environment
- **data_sources**: Connection details for the database

## Step 3 - Apply Configuration

Now apply the configuration:

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Step 4 - Verify Setup

1. Go to **Instances** in Bytebase.
2. Verify both instances show:
   - Correct environment assignment
   - `Y` under License column (if using Enterprise)

You can now modify instance properties through Terraform. For example, to rename an instance:

```hcl
resource "bytebase_instance" "test" {
  # ... other config ...
  title = "Development Database"  # Changed title
}
```

## Summary and Next Steps

You've successfully registered database instances with Terraform!
