Moving schema changes from test to production is a critical part of the database development lifecycle. Bytebase provides two primary methods to safely promote your changes across environments.

This tutorial uses the sample data in our [demo environment](https://demo.bytebase.com/). Select **Basic Project** from the project selector in the upper-left to begin.

## Option 1: Streamlined rollout (Recommended)

Deploy changes to multiple environments in a single workflow:

1. Navigate to **CI/CD > Plans** and click **+ New Plan**.
2. Select **Schema Migration** as the change type.
3. Choose both `test` and `prod` databases as targets.
4. Enter your SQL changes in the editor.
5. Click **Create**, then **Ready for Review**.
6. After checks pass, go to the **Rollout** tab.
7. Click **Run** for each environment in sequence (test first, then prod).

This method ensures consistent changes across environments and maintains a clear audit trail.

## Option 2: Schema synchronization

Use this method when changes already exist in test and need to be replicated to production:

1. First, apply changes to the test database:
   - Navigate to **CI/CD > Plans** and click **+ New Plan**.
   - Select **Schema Migration** and choose only the `test` database.
   - Enter your SQL changes and click **Create**.
   - Click **Ready for Review**, then rollout the changes.

2. Synchronize test schema to production:
   - Navigate to **Sync Schema** in the left sidebar.
   - Select `test` as the source database.
   - Choose the desired schema version and click **Next**.

3. Select `prod` as the target database:

4. Review the schema differences:
   - Bytebase displays a detailed diff between test (source) and prod (target).
   - Verify the changes match your expectations.
   - Click **Preview issue** to proceed.

5. Deploy the changes:
   - Click **Create** to generate the synchronization issue.
   - Click **Ready for Review** to trigger automated checks.
   - Navigate to the **Rollout** tab and click **Run**.

The schema changes are now synchronized from test to production.

## Which method to choose?

- **Streamlined rollout**: Best for new changes that need to be deployed to multiple environments.
- **Schema synchronization**: Ideal when test already has changes that need to be replicated to production.
