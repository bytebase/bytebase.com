We're demonstrating this process using our sample [demo](https://demo.bytebase.com/) data in the Basic Project. **Select Project** on the upper-left where you choose `Basic Project`. Now you can operate within the project.

You have three options to move schema change from `test` to `prod` as follows.

## Option 1: Streamlined rollout

Go to **Database** -> **Databases** section on the left-side bar. Select both databases to **Edit Schema**, where you type in raw SQL code in the code block and click **Create**. Checks will automatically run and then you can **Approve** the change and **Rollout**.

## Option 2: Schema Synchronization

Also within **Database** -> **Databases** section on the left-side bar in `Basic Project` interface, select only `test` database to **Edit Schema**. Create, Approve and Rollout like we did to the two databases in Option 1.

Then enter [**Sync Schema**](/change-database/synchronize-schema/) on the left-side bar. Select `test` in **Database** to refer to, and choose a **Schema version**. Click **Next**.

Select `prod` as target database.

You can see how Bytebase shows the diff between the test database (source) and the prod database (target). **Preview issue** to deploy the difference

![select-target-databases-2](/content/docs/tutorials/how-to-move-schema-change-from-test-to-prod/select-target-databases-2.webp)

**Create** this issue, approve and deploy as we did before.

![select-target-databases-3](/content/docs/tutorials/how-to-move-schema-change-from-test-to-prod/select-target-databases-3.webp)

Thus we have successfully propagate the change from `test` to `prod`.
