This tutorial series uses separate Terraform files for better organization. Files are numbered by tutorial part and sub-step (e.g., `1-1-env-setting.tf`, `1-2-env-policy-rollout.tf` for Part 1, `2-instances.tf` for Part 2, etc.). Terraform automatically handles dependencies between files.

## What You'll Learn

- **Create** users and service accounts for team members
- **Organize** users into groups for easier management
- **Understand** the difference between users and service accounts
- **Prepare** for setting up permissions in the next tutorial

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:

- Completed [Part 5: Manage SQL Review Rules with Terraform](/tutorials/manage-sql-review-rules-with-terraform)
- Bytebase running with service account configured
- Your Terraform files from the previous tutorials

## Setup

From the previous tutorials, you should have:

- Bytebase instances and projects configured
- Workspace settings and approval flows set up
- Service account with `Workspace Admin` role

## Understanding User Management in Bytebase

<Info>
  Bytebase uses an Identity and Access Management (IAM) system with: - **Users**: Individual
  accounts for team members - **Service Accounts**: Automated accounts for API/Terraform access -
  **Groups**: Collections of users for easier permission management
</Info>

## Configure Users and Groups

### Step 1 - Create Users and Service Accounts

Create `6-1-users.tf` to define your team structure:

```hcl
# Workspace administrators
resource "bytebase_user" "workspace_admin" {
  email = "admin@example.com"
  title = "Workspace Admin"
  type  = "USER"
}

# Service account for automation
resource "bytebase_user" "tf_service_account" {
  email = "tf@service.bytebase.com"
  title = "Terraform Service Account"
  type  = "SERVICE_ACCOUNT"  # SERVICE_ACCOUNT type for API access
}

# Database administrators
resource "bytebase_user" "workspace_dba1" {
  email = "dba@example.com"
  title = "Database Administrator 1"
  type  = "USER"
}

resource "bytebase_user" "workspace_dba2" {
  email = "dba2@example.com"
  title = "Database Administrator 2"
  type  = "USER"
}

# Development team members
resource "bytebase_user" "dev1" {
  email = "dev1@example.com"
  title = "Developer 1"
  type  = "USER"
}

resource "bytebase_user" "dev2" {
  email = "dev2@example.com"
  title = "Developer 2"
  type  = "USER"
}

resource "bytebase_user" "dev3" {
  email = "dev3@example.com"
  title = "Developer 3"
  type  = "USER"
}

# QA team members
resource "bytebase_user" "qa1" {
  email = "qa1@example.com"
  title = "QA Tester 1"
  type  = "USER"
}

resource "bytebase_user" "qa2" {
  email = "qa2@example.com"
  title = "QA Tester 2"
  type  = "USER"
}
```

### Step 2 - Apply User Configuration

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Step 3 - Create Groups

Groups simplify permission management by allowing you to assign roles to multiple users at once.

<Tip>
  Each group has an owner who can manage group membership. Regular members inherit permissions
  assigned to the group.
</Tip>

Add the following groups to your `6-2-groups.tf` file:

```hcl
# Create groups
resource "bytebase_group" "developers" {
  email       = "developers@example.com"
  title       = "Developer Team"
  description = "Group for all developers"

  members {
    member = "users/${bytebase_user.dev1.email}"
    role   = "OWNER"
  }

  members {
    member = "users/${bytebase_user.dev2.email}"
    role   = "MEMBER"
  }

  members {
    member = "users/${bytebase_user.dev3.email}"
    role   = "MEMBER"
  }
}

resource "bytebase_group" "qa" {
  email       = "qa@example.com"
  title       = "QA Team"
  description = "Group for all QA testers"

  members {
    member = "users/${bytebase_user.qa1.email}"
    role   = "OWNER"
  }

  members {
    member = "users/${bytebase_user.qa2.email}"
    role   = "MEMBER"
  }
}
```

### Step 4 - Apply Complete Configuration

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Step 5 - Verify in Bytebase

1. Go to **IAM & Admin > Users & Groups** to see all users:

   ![users](/content/docs/tutorials/manage-database-access-control-with-terraform/bb-users.webp)

2. Click the **Groups** tab to verify groups:

   - **Developer Team**: 3 members (dev1 as owner, dev2 and dev3 as members)
   - **QA Team**: 2 members (qa1 as owner, qa2 as member)

   ![groups](/content/docs/tutorials/manage-database-access-control-with-terraform/bb-groups.webp)

## Key Points

- **User Types**: Regular users (`USER`) for team members, service accounts (`SERVICE_ACCOUNT`) for API/automation
- **Group Roles**: Each group has owners (manage membership) and members (inherit permissions)
- **Organization**: Groups simplify permission management - assign roles to groups instead of individual users
- **Next Tutorial**: These users and groups will be assigned specific database permissions in Part 7

## Next Steps

**Continue the series:** [Manage Database Access Control with Terraform](/tutorials/manage-database-access-control-with-terraform) - define permissions and access policies.
