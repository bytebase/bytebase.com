## What You'll Learn

Create projects to organize your databases into logical groups.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:

- **Completed Parts 1 & 2**: Environments and instances configured
- **Built-in instances**: `Test Sample Instance` and `Prod Sample Instance` from sample data
- **Terraform workspace**: From previous tutorials

## Step 1 - Understand Current Setup

From previous tutorials, you have:

- **Test instance** with `hr_test` and `postgres` databases
- **Prod instance** with `hr_prod` and `postgres` databases

Currently, these `hr_test` and `hr_prod` databases are in the default `Sample Project`, while `postgres` databases are unassigned. You can view them in Bytebase by clicking **Databases** on the left sidebar. Let's organize them into new projects.

## Step 2 - Create Projects

Create `3-projects.tf`:

```hcl
# Project One - All test databases
resource "bytebase_project" "project_one" {
  depends_on  = [bytebase_instance.test]
  resource_id = "project-one"
  title       = "Project One"

  # Automatically include all databases from test instance
  databases = bytebase_instance.test.databases
}

# Project Two - Specific production database
resource "bytebase_project" "project_two" {
  depends_on  = [bytebase_instance.prod]
  resource_id = "project-two"
  title       = "Project Two"

  # Explicitly specify which database to include
  databases = [
    "instances/prod-sample-instance/databases/hr_prod"
  ]
}
```

### Two Assignment Patterns

1. **Dynamic**: `databases = bytebase_instance.test.databases`

   - Automatically includes all databases from an instance
   - Good for development/test environments

1. **Explicit**: `databases = ["instances/.../databases/..."]`
   - Manually specify each database
   - Better control for production

## Step 3 - Apply Configuration

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Step 4 - Verify Projects

1. Go to **Projects** in Bytebase.

1. You'll see three projects:

   - **Sample Project** (original, now empty)

   - **Project One** (contains `hr_test` and `postgres` which are both from `Test Sample Instance`)

     ![project-1](/content/docs/tutorials/manage-projects-with-terraform/bb-project-1.webp)

   - **Project Two** (contains `hr_prod` which is from `Prod Sample Instance`)

     ![project-2](/content/docs/tutorials/manage-projects-with-terraform/bb-project-2.webp)

## Summary and Next Steps

You've successfully organized databases into projects! Key takeaways:

- **Projects group related databases** for better organization
- **Two assignment patterns**: dynamic (all databases) or explicit (specific databases)
- **Projects span environments**: can include both test and prod databases

Continue with [Part 4: Manage Bytebase Settings with Terraform](/tutorials/manage-general-settings-with-terraform) to configure workspace-level settings.
