## What You'll Learn

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

- **Organize** databases into logical project groups for better management
- **Configure** project-specific settings and policies
- **Set up** webhooks for project notifications
- **Choose** between dynamic and explicit database assignment patterns

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:

- Completed [Part 1: Manage Environments with Terraform](/tutorials/manage-environments-with-terraform) and [Part 2: Manage Databases with Terraform](/tutorials/manage-databases-with-terraform)
- Access to the built-in `Test Sample Instance` and `Prod Sample Instance` from Bytebase sample data
- Your Terraform workspace from the previous tutorials

## Step 1 - Understand Current Setup

From the previous tutorials, your Bytebase workspace contains:

- **Test instance**: Contains `hr_test` and `postgres` databases
- **Prod instance**: Contains `hr_prod` and `postgres` databases

Currently, the `hr_test` and `hr_prod` databases are assigned to the default `Sample Project`, while the `postgres` databases remain unassigned. You can verify this by navigating to **Databases** in the left sidebar. We'll now organize these databases into dedicated projects for better management.

## Step 2 - Create Projects

|                       |                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Terraform resource    | [bytebase_project](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/bytebase/bytebase/latest/docs/resources/project)           |
| Sample file           | [3-projects.tf](https://github.com/bytebase/terraform-provider-bytebase/blob/main/tutorials/3-projects.tf)           |

Create `3-projects.tf`:

```hcl 3-projects.tf
# Project One - Development/Test Environment
# Uses dynamic assignment to automatically include all test databases
resource "bytebase_project" "project_one" {
  depends_on  = [bytebase_instance.test]
  resource_id = "project-one"
  title       = "Project One"

  # Project-level configurations for development workflow
  allow_modify_statement = true   # Allow direct SQL modifications
  auto_resolve_issue     = false  # Manual issue resolution for review
  auto_enable_backup     = false  # Disable automatic backups for test data

  # Dynamically include all databases from the test instance
  databases = bytebase_instance.test.databases

  # Configure Slack notifications for team collaboration
  webhooks {
    title = "Sample webhook 1"
    type  = "SLACK"
    url   = "https://webhook.site/91fcd52a-39f1-4e7b-a43a-ddf72796d6b1"
    notification_types = [
      "NOTIFY_ISSUE_APPROVED",
      "NOTIFY_PIPELINE_ROLLOUT",
      "ISSUE_CREATE",
    ]
  }
}

# Project Two - Production Environment  
# Uses explicit assignment for precise control over production databases
resource "bytebase_project" "project_two" {
  depends_on  = [bytebase_instance.prod]
  resource_id = "project-two"
  title       = "Project Two"

  # Explicitly specify which production databases to include
  databases = [
    "instances/prod-sample-instance/databases/hr_prod"
  ]
}
```

<Note>
The configuration above demonstrates project-level settings including webhook notifications. For a complete list of available project configurations, refer to the [Terraform provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/bytebase/bytebase/latest/docs/data-sources/project).

  You can also configure SQL review policies at the project level. Learn more in [Part 5: Manage SQL Review Rules with Terraform](/tutorials/manage-sql-review-rules-with-terraform).
</Note>

### Database Assignment Patterns

Choose the appropriate pattern based on your project's needs:

#### Dynamic Assignment

```hcl
databases = bytebase_instance.test.databases
```

- **Automatically includes** all databases from a specified instance
- **Best for**: Development and testing environments where databases change frequently
- **Benefit**: Self-maintaining as new databases are automatically included

#### Explicit Assignment

```hcl
databases = ["instances/prod-sample-instance/databases/hr_prod"]
```

- **Manually specify** each database by its full path
- **Best for**: Production environments requiring precise control
- **Benefit**: Granular control over which databases belong to the project

## Step 3 - Apply Configuration

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Step 4 - Verify Projects

1. Navigate to **Projects** in the Bytebase GUI.

1. You should now see three projects organized as follows:

   - **Sample Project** (original default project, now empty after database migration)

   - **Project One** (contains both `hr_test` and `postgres` databases from `Test Sample Instance`)

     ![project-1](/content/docs/tutorials/manage-projects-with-terraform/bb-project-1.webp)

   - **Project Two** (contains the `hr_prod` database from `Prod Sample Instance`)

     ![project-2](/content/docs/tutorials/manage-projects-with-terraform/bb-project-2.webp)

1. Click on **Project One** and navigate to **Settings** to review the configurations you've applied.

1. Click **Webhooks** and you'll see the webhook you set.

## Summary and Next Steps

Congratulations! You've successfully organized your databases into logical projects. Here are the key concepts you've learned:

- **Project Organization**: Projects serve as logical containers that group related databases for improved management and governance
- **Assignment Flexibility**: Choose between dynamic assignment (automatic inclusion) for development environments or explicit assignment (manual control) for production
- **Cross-Environment Projects**: Projects can span multiple environments, though it's often better to separate test and production databases into different projects
- **Project Configuration**: Customize project behavior with settings like statement modification permissions, automatic issue resolution, and backup policies
- **Notification Integration**: Set up webhooks to keep your team informed about project activities through Slack or other channels
