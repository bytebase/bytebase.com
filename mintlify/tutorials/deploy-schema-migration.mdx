Bytebase provides a powerful GUI for deploying schema migrations. This tutorial walks you through deploying schema changes with features such as SQL Review, rollout policies, custom approval, time scheduling, and more.

Bytebase offers **Community**, **Pro**, and **Enterprise** [plans](https://www.bytebase.com/pricing). Higher plans unlock additional deployment capabilities. We will explore them progressively.

### Features covered

- Level 1 – [Automatic rollout (Rollout Policy)](/change-database/environment-policy/rollout-policy/) (available in all plans)
- Level 2 – Manual rollout with [SQL Review](/sql-review/review-policy/) (available in all plans)
- Level 3 – [Custom Approval](/change-database/approval/) (available in Enterprise)

### Preparation

<PreparationWithSampleData />

### Level 1: Automatic rollout in the Test environment (All plans)

1. In Workspace, go to **Environments** > **Test**, and check `Automatic` under the **Rollout policy**.

1. From the top-left project switcher, select `Sample Project`. Under the **CI/CD** section, click **Plans**, then **+ New Plan**. Choose `Schema Migration (DDL)` and select the `hr_test` database.

1. Using the **Schema Editor**, add a new column `nickname` to the `employee` table and click **Confirm**.

   ![plan-schema-editor-nickname](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-plan-schema-editor-nickname.webp)

1. Click **Create**, then click **Ready for Review**.

   ![plan-test-to-review](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-plan-test-to-review.webp)

1. The rollout executes automatically to the `Test` environment. The issue is marked as `Done`.

### Level 2: Manual rollout with SQL Review (All plans)

1. In Workspace, go to **Environments** > **Prod**. Leave the `Automatic` unchecked under the **Rollout policy**. Keep the default Setting without changing, it's `Require Issue Approval` and `Plan Check Enforcement`>`Block on Errors Only`.

   ![rollout-policy-manual-default](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-rollout-policy-manual-default.webp)

1. We'll add an SQL Review policy to the `Prod` environment. Click **SQL Review Policy** to open **SQL Review** under the **Environment > Prod**. Select the `Sample Template`, which has 20 enabled rules.

   ![sql-review-sample](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-sql-review-sample.webp)

1. Click **Confirm** to add the SQL Review policy to the `Prod` environment.

   ![sql-review-prod](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-sql-review-prod.webp)

1. From the top-left project switcher, select `Sample Project`. Under the **CI/CD** section, click **Plans**, then **+ New Plan**. Choose `Schema Migration (DDL)` and select the `hr_prod` database.

   ![plan-db-prod](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-plan-db-prod.webp)

1. Using the **Schema Editor**, add a new column `nickname` to the `employee` table and click **Confirm**.

   ![plan-schema-editor-nickname](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-plan-schema-editor-nickname.webp)

1. Intentionally violate the `NOT NULL` rule. Click **Create**; SQL Review runs automatically and shows a warning for the `Prod` task.

   ![plan-to-review-warning](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-plan-to-review-warning.webp)

1. Click the warning to view details.

   ![plan-to-review-warning-detail](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-plan-to-review-warning-detail.webp)

1. Go to the **Rollout** tab, click **Run**. You will see a warning that the SQL Review is not passed. However, you can bypass the SQL Review by checking **Bypass** to continue rollout.

   ![run-warning](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-run-warning.webp)

1. Go back to the `Prod` environment, and set `Plan Check Enforcement` > `Strict Enforcement` under the **Rollout Policy**, then come back to the plan and refresh, you will see this time you can't bypass the SQL Review.

   ![run-error](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-run-error.webp)

1. Fix the SQL by adding the `NOT NULL` constraint. Click **Save** to update the plan. SQL Review runs again and should pass. Click **Ready for Review** to submit the plan for approval. Cuz here we don't have approval flow configured, so the plan will be approved automatically.

   ![plan-to-review-pass](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-plan-to-review-pass.webp)

1. The rollout is now ready, click **Run** again, this time you will see the SQL Review is passed.

   ![rollout-prod-to-run-detail](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-rollout-prod-to-run-detail.webp)

1. After the rollout completes, the issue is marked as `Done`.

### Level 3: Manual rollout with custom approval (Enterprise)

If you want the approval flow to be dynamic based on context, such as the type of SQL statements, follow this tutorial: [Database Change with Risk-Based Approval Flow](/tutorials/database-change-management-with-risk-adjusted-approval-flow/).
