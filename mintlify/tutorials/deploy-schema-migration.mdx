Bytebase offers **Community**, **Pro** and **Enterprise** [Plans](https://www.bytebase.com/pricing). Advanced plans
unlock new capabilities of deploying schema migrations and this tutorial will walk you through them progressively.

### Features covered

- Level 1 - [Automatic SQL Review](/sql-review/overview/) (available in all plans)
- Level 2 - [Rollout Policy](/administration/environment-policy/rollout-policy/) (available in all plans)
- Level 3 - [Custom Approval](/administration/custom-approval/) (available in Enterprise)

### Preparation

1. Make sure your Docker is running, and start the Bytebase Docker container with the following command:

   <TerminalDockerRunVolume />

1. Bytebase is running successfully in Docker, and you can visit it via `localhost:8080`. Register an admin account and it will be granted the `workspace admin` role automatically.

1. While setting up the workspace, choose built-in sample data.

### Level 1: Automatic rollout on Test environment (Community Plan)

1. Within Workspace, go to **Environments** > **Test**, and set the rollout policy to `Automatic`.

   ![env-test-auto](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-env-test-auto.webp)

1. Go to `Sample Project` from top left. Click **Plan** under **CI/CD** section. Click **+ New Plan** to create a new plan. Choose `Schema Migration (DDL)` as the change type and then select `hr_test` database.

   ![plan-db-test](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-plan-db-test.webp)

1. Via the **Schema Editor**, add a new column `nickname` to the `employee` table and click **Confirm**.

   ![plan-schema-editor-nickname](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-plan-schema-editor-nickname.webp)

1. Click **Create** and then **Ready for Review**.

   ![plan-test-to-create](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-plan-test-to-create.webp)
   ![plan-test-to-review](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-plan-test-to-review.webp)

1. The rollout will be automatically executed to `Test` environment. The issue will be marked as `Done`.

   ![plan-test-auto-rollout-done](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-plan-test-auto-rollout-done.webp)

### Level 2: Manual rollout with SQL Review (Community Plan)

1. Within Workspace, go to **Environments** > **Prod**. Left the rollout policy unchanged, the default setting is `Manual`. But we'll add a SQL Review policy to the `Prod` environment.

   ![env-prod-sql-review](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-env-prod-sql-review.webp)

1. Click **SQL Review Policy** to enter **SQL Review** under **CI/CD** section, where we will choose the `Sample Template` which has 20 enabled rules.

   ![sql-review-sample](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-sql-review-sample.webp)

1. Click **Confirm** to add the SQL Review policy to the `Prod` environment.

   ![sql-review-prod](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-sql-review-prod.webp)

1. Go to `Sample Project` from top left. Click **Plan** under **CI/CD** section. Click **+ New Plan** to create a new plan. Choose `Schema Migration (DDL)` as the change type and then select `hr_prod` database.

   ![plan-db-prod](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-plan-db-prod.webp)

1. Via the **Schema Editor**, add a new column `nickname` to the `employee` table and click **Confirm**.

   ![plan-schema-editor-nickname](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-plan-schema-editor-nickname.webp)

1. This time, we'll intentionally violate the `NOT NULL` rule. Click **Create** and then the SQL Review will run automatically. There's a warning for the task on `Prod`.

   ![plan-to-review-warning](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-plan-to-review-warning.webp)

1. Click the warning to see the details.

   ![plan-to-review-warning-detail](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-plan-to-review-warning-detail.webp)

1. Fix the SQL statement by adding `NOT NULL` constraint. Click **Save** to update the plan. The SQL Review checks will run again and should now pass. Click **Ready for Review** and then **Confirm** to submit the plan for approval.

   ![plan-to-review-pass](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-plan-to-review-pass.webp)

1. Now the rollout is ready for you to execute manually.

   ![plan-prod-to-rollout](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-plan-prod-to-rollout.webp)

1. Click **Rollout** and then click **Run**.

   ![rollout-prod-to-run](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-rollout-prod-to-run.webp)
   ![rollout-prod-to-run-detail](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-rollout-prod-to-run-detail.webp)

1. After the rollout is executed, the issue will be marked as `Done`.

   ![plan-prod-manual-rollout-done](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-plan-prod-manual-rollout-done.webp)

### Level 3: Manual rollout with custom approval (Enterprise Plan)

If you want the approval flow to be more dynamic based on the context like the type of SQL statements, follow this tutorial [Database Change with Risk-Based Approval Flow](/tutorials/database-change-management-with-risk-adjusted-approval-flow/).
