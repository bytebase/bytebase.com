Bytebase offers a powerful GUI for schema migration deployments. This tutorial will show you how to use Bytebase to deploy schema migrations with features like SQL Review, custom approval, time scheduling, and more.

Bytebase offers **Community**, **Pro** and **Enterprise** [Plans](https://www.bytebase.com/pricing). Advanced plans
unlock new capabilities of deploying schema migrations and this tutorial will walk you through them progressively.

### Features covered

- Level 1 - [Automatic SQL Review](/sql-review/overview/) (available in all plans)
- Level 2 - [Rollout Policy](/administration/environment-policy/rollout-policy/) (available in all plans)
- Level 3 - [Custom Approval](/administration/custom-approval/) (available in Enterprise)

### Preparation

1. Make sure your Docker is running, and start the Bytebase Docker container with the following command:

   <TerminalDockerRunVolume />

1. Bytebase is running successfully in Docker, and you can visit it via `localhost:8080`. Register an admin account and it will be granted the `workspace admin` role automatically.

### Level 1: Automatic rollout with SQL review (Community Plan)

1. Within Workspace, go to **Environments** > **Test** and **Environments** > **Prod**, you'll see

   - Check `automatic` as `Rollout policy`. Unless there's warning or error, rollout will be automatically executed after an issue is created.
   - `SQL Review` is enabled on `Prod` with a sample policy (with 20 rules).

1. Click **SQL Review Policy** to enter **SQL Review** under **CI/CD** section, where three rules have been activated. We'll intentionally violate the Column rule `Enforce NOT NULL constraints on columns`.

1. Go to `Sample Project` from top left. Go to **Database** > **Databases**, choose both `hr_prod` and `hr_test` databases to **Edit Schema**. Paste this command into **SQL** block, and **Create** this issue on top right:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE "public"."employee"
       ADD COLUMN "country" text;
   ```

1. SQL Review will run automatically along with some other checks. You'll see a warning for the task on `Prod`. Click `Prod Stage` of the pipe above for details.

1. Edit the SQL statement with this:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE "public"."employee"
   ADD COLUMN "country" text NOT NULL DEFAULT '';
   ```

1. Now you'll see the warning disappear and the issue rolls out automatically. Click **View change** to see the diff.

### Level 2: Manual rollout with dedicated roles(Community Plan)

You can specify multiple pre-defined roles to manually deploy the change.

If you want **Time scheduling** feature, you will need to upgrade to **Pro Plan**.

1. Within Workspace, go to **Environments** > **Prod**. Uncheck `Automatic`. Choose several roles according to your needs and also check `Issue Creator`. Click **Update** on bottom right.

   ![bb-env-manual](/content/docs/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/bb-env-manual.webp)

1. Go to `Sample Project`, enter **Database** > **Databases** to **Edit Schema** for both databases. Paste this command into **SQL** block and **Create**.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE "public"."employee"
       ADD COLUMN "city" text NOT NULL DEFAULT '';
   ```

1. **Task checks** runs. SQL runs on `Test` automatically but waits to run on `Prod`. Click **Rollout** to trigger directly.

### Level 3: Manual rollout with custom approval (Enterprise Plan)

If you want the approval flow to be more dynamic based on the context like the type of SQL statements, follow this tutorial [Database Change with Risk-Based Approval Flow](/tutorials/database-change-management-with-risk-adjusted-approval-flow/).


### Summary

You have now learned how to use Bytebase to deploy schema migration in a basic way. Bytebase also provides other advanced features for your interests:

- [GitOps](/vcs-integration/overview/) - Observe Git code push events and trigger schema migration;
- [Batch changes](/change-database/batch-change/) - Change multiple databases in a single workflow;
- [Changelist](/changelist/) - Organize and apply changes sequentially, or export them for offline execution.
