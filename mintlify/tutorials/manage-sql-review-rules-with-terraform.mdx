This tutorial is part of the **Manage Bytebase with Terraform** series:

- Part 1: [Manage Databases with Terraform](/tutorials/manage-databases-in-bytebase-with-terraform) - Set up instances and environments
- Part 2: [Manage Projects with Terraform](/tutorials/manage-projects-in-bytebase-with-terraform) - Organize databases into projects
- Part 3: [Manage Bytebase Settings with Terraform](/tutorials/manage-bytebase-settings-with-terraform) - Configure workspace settings, environment policies, approval flows, and risk management
- Part 4: Manage SQL Review Rules with Terraform (This one) - Set up SQL review policies
- Part 5: [Manage Database Access Control with Terraform](/tutorials/manage-database-access-control-with-terraform) - Set up access controls and permissions
- Part 6: [Manage Data Masking with Terraform](/tutorials/manage-data-masking-with-terraform) - Configure data masking policies

**File Structure**: This tutorial series uses separate Terraform files for better organization. Files are numbered by tutorial part and sub-step (e.g., `1-1-env.tf`, `1-2-instances.tf` for Part 1, `2-projects.tf` for Part 2, etc.). Terraform automatically handles dependencies between files.

Learn how to configure SQL review rules to enforce database schema standards using Terraform and the [Terraform Bytebase Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/bytebase/bytebase/latest/docs).

<Note>

Bytebase Terraform Provider handles control plane configuration such as settings, policies, access controls. It does not
handle data plane operations such as database creation, schema migrations, DML execution, query.

</Note>

## What You'll Learn

- **Configure** SQL review rules for schema standards
- **Enforce** naming conventions and structural requirements
- **Apply** different severity levels (ERROR, WARNING)
- **Target** specific environments with review policies

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:

- Completed [Part 3: Manage Bytebase Settings with Terraform](/tutorials/manage-bytebase-settings-with-terraform)
- Bytebase running with ngrok and service account configured
- Your Terraform files from the previous tutorials

## Setup

From the previous tutorials, you should have:
- Bytebase instances and projects configured
- Environments (test and prod) set up
- Workspace settings and approval flows configured

## Configure SQL Review Rules

### Step 1 - Create Review Configuration

Create `4-sql-review.tf` with the SQL review configuration:

```hcl
resource "bytebase_review_config" "sample" {
  depends_on = [
    bytebase_setting.environments
  ]

  resource_id = "review-config-sample"
  title       = "Sample SQL Review Config"
  enabled     = true
  resources = toset([
    bytebase_setting.environments.environment_setting[0].environment[1].name
  ])
  
  # Rule 1: Warn about nullable columns
  rules {
    type   = "column.no-null"
    engine = "POSTGRES"
    level  = "WARNING"
  }
  
  # Rule 2: Require specific columns
  rules {
    type    = "column.required"
    engine  = "POSTGRES"
    level   = "ERROR"
    payload = "{\"list\":[\"id\",\"created_ts\",\"updated_ts\",\"creator_id\",\"updater_id\"]}"
  }
  
  # Rule 3: Tables must have primary key
  rules {
    type   = "table.require-pk"
    engine = "POSTGRES"
    level  = "ERROR"
  }
  
  # Rule 4: Column naming convention
  rules {
    type    = "naming.column"
    engine  = "POSTGRES"
    level   = "ERROR"
    payload = "{\"format\":\"^[a-z]+(_[a-z]+)*$\",\"maxLength\":64}"
  }
  
  # Rule 5: Limit maximum rows in SELECT
  rules {
    type    = "statement.maximum-limit-value"
    engine  = "POSTGRES"
    level   = "ERROR"
    payload = "{\"number\":1000}"
  }
}
```

### Step 2 - Apply Configuration

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Step 3 - Verify in Bytebase

1. Go to **CI/CD > SQL Review** in the left sidebar.
2. You should see **Sample SQL Review Config** listed.
3. Click on it to view the configured rules.
4. Note that it's applied to the production environment.

## Rule Types Explained

The example demonstrates key SQL review rule categories:

### 1. Column Rules
- **column.no-null**: Warns about nullable columns
- **column.required**: Enforces required columns (id, timestamps, audit fields)

### 2. Table Rules
- **table.require-pk**: Every table must have a primary key

### 3. Naming Rules
- **naming.column**: Enforces lowercase snake_case column names

### 4. Statement Rules
- **statement.maximum-limit-value**: Prevents SELECT queries without proper limits

### Step 4 - Test SQL Review

Create a test SQL statement to see the review in action:

1. Go to **Project Two** > **Database** > **hr_prod**
2. Click **Edit Schema**
3. Try creating a table that violates the rules:

```sql
-- This will trigger multiple violations
CREATE TABLE BadExample (
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),  -- Violates naming convention
    LastName VARCHAR(50)    -- Missing required columns, no primary key
);
```

Expected violations:
- ‚ùå Column naming convention (should be first_name)
- ‚ùå Missing required columns (id, created_ts, etc.)
- ‚ùå No primary key defined

4. Try a compliant table:

```sql
-- This follows all rules
CREATE TABLE good_example (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    created_ts TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_ts TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    creator_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    updater_id INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

Expected result:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning about nullable columns (if any)
- ‚úÖ All required rules pass

## Advanced Configuration

### Targeting Multiple Environments

To apply rules to multiple environments:

```hcl
resources = toset([
  "environments/test",
  "environments/prod"
])
```

### Engine-Specific Rules

Different rules for different database engines:

```hcl
# MySQL-specific rule
rules {
  type   = "table.require-pk"
  engine = "MYSQL"
  level  = "ERROR"
}

# PostgreSQL-specific rule
rules {
  type   = "table.require-pk"
  engine = "POSTGRES"
  level  = "ERROR"
}
```

## Key Points

- **Rule Levels**: ERROR blocks changes, WARNING allows but notifies
- **Engine Specific**: Rules can target specific database engines
- **Environment Scoped**: Apply different rules to different environments
- **Payload Format**: Complex rules use JSON payloads for configuration

## Next Steps

**Continue the series:** [Manage Database Access Control with Terraform](/tutorials/manage-database-access-control-with-terraform) - set up access controls and permissions.
