📚 [Complete tutorial terraform files on GitHub](https://github.com/bytebase/terraform-provider-bytebase/tree/main/tutorials)

**File Structure**: This tutorial series uses separate Terraform files for better organization. Files are numbered by tutorial part and sub-step (e.g., `1-1-env.tf`, `1-2-instances.tf` for Part 1, `2-projects.tf` for Part 2, etc.). Terraform automatically handles dependencies between files.

Learn how to manage users, groups, and access control policies using Terraform and the [Terraform Bytebase Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/bytebase/bytebase/latest/docs).

<Note>

Bytebase Terraform Provider handles control plane configuration such as settings, policies, access controls. It does not
handle data plane operations such as database creation, schema migrations, DML execution, query.

</Note>

## What You'll Learn

- **Create** users and service accounts for team members
- **Organize** users into groups for easier management
- **Configure** workspace-level IAM policies for role assignments
- **Set up** project-level permissions with granular database access

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:

- Completed [Part 4: Manage SQL Review Rules with Terraform](/tutorials/manage-sql-review-rules-with-terraform)
- Bytebase running with ngrok and service account configured
- Your Terraform files from the previous tutorials

## Setup

From the previous tutorials, you should have:

- Bytebase instances and projects configured
- Workspace settings and approval flows set up
- Service account with Workspace Admin role

## Configure Access Control

### Step 1 - Create Users

Create `5-user-iam.tf` with user resources:

```hcl
# Create users and service accounts
resource "bytebase_user" "workspace_admin" {
  email = "admin@example.com"
  title = "Workspace Admin"
  type  = "USER"
}

resource "bytebase_user" "tf_service_account" {
  email = "tf@service.bytebase.com"
  title = "Terraform Service Account"
  type  = "SERVICE_ACCOUNT"
}

resource "bytebase_user" "workspace_dba1" {
  email = "dba@example.com"
  title = "Database Administrator 1"
  type  = "USER"
}

resource "bytebase_user" "workspace_dba2" {
  email = "dba2@example.com"
  title = "Database Administrator 2"
  type  = "USER"
}

resource "bytebase_user" "dev1" {
  email = "dev1@example.com"
  title = "Developer 1"
  type  = "USER"
}

resource "bytebase_user" "dev2" {
  email = "dev2@example.com"
  title = "Developer 2"
  type  = "USER"
}

resource "bytebase_user" "dev3" {
  email = "dev3@example.com"
  title = "Developer 3"
  type  = "USER"
}

resource "bytebase_user" "qa1" {
  email = "qa1@example.com"
  title = "QA Tester 1"
  type  = "USER"
}

resource "bytebase_user" "qa2" {
  email = "qa2@example.com"
  title = "QA Tester 2"
  type  = "USER"
}
```

#### Apply and Verify Users

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Verify in Bytebase:

1. Go to **IAM & Admin > Users & Groups**.
1. You should see all 9 users created.

### Step 2 - Create Groups

Add the following groups to your `5-user-iam.tf` file:

```hcl
# Create groups
resource "bytebase_group" "developers" {
  email       = "developers@example.com"
  title       = "Developer Team"
  description = "Group for all developers"

  members {
    member = "users/${bytebase_user.dev1.email}"
    role   = "OWNER"
  }

  members {
    member = "users/${bytebase_user.dev2.email}"
    role   = "MEMBER"
  }

  members {
    member = "users/${bytebase_user.dev3.email}"
    role   = "MEMBER"
  }
}

resource "bytebase_group" "qa" {
  email       = "qa@example.com"
  title       = "QA Team"
  description = "Group for all QA testers"

  members {
    member = "users/${bytebase_user.qa1.email}"
    role   = "OWNER"
  }

  members {
    member = "users/${bytebase_user.qa2.email}"
    role   = "MEMBER"
  }
}
```

#### Apply and Verify Groups

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Verify in Bytebase:

1. Go to **IAM & Admin > Users & Groups** > **Groups** tab.
1. Click on **Developer Team** to see 3 members (dev1 as owner, dev2 and dev3 as members).
1. Click on **QA Team** to see 2 members (qa1 as owner, qa2 as member).

### Step 3 - Configure Workspace IAM Policy

Add the following workspace IAM policy to your `5-user-iam.tf` file. Note that project roles assigned at workspace level apply to ALL projects:

```hcl
resource "bytebase_iam_policy" "workspace_iam" {
  depends_on = [
    bytebase_user.workspace_admin,
    bytebase_user.tf_service_account,
    bytebase_user.workspace_dba1,
    bytebase_user.workspace_dba2,
    bytebase_group.qa
  ]

  parent = "workspaces/-"

  iam_policy {

    binding {
      role = "roles/workspaceAdmin"
      members = [
        format("user:%s", bytebase_user.workspace_admin.email),
        format("user:%s", bytebase_user.tf_service_account.email),
      ]
    }

    binding {
      role = "roles/workspaceDBA"
      members = [
        format("user:%s", bytebase_user.workspace_dba1.email),
        format("user:%s", bytebase_user.workspace_dba2.email)
      ]
    }

    binding {
      role = "roles/workspaceMember"
      members = [
        format("user:%s", bytebase_user.dev1.email),
        format("user:%s", bytebase_user.dev2.email),
        format("user:%s", bytebase_user.dev3.email),
        format("user:%s", bytebase_user.qa1.email),
        format("user:%s", bytebase_user.qa2.email)
      ]
    }

    binding {
      role = "roles/projectViewer"
      members = [
        format("group:%s", bytebase_group.qa.email),
      ]
      # Note: This grants projectViewer role to ALL projects in the workspace
    }
  }
}
```

#### Apply and Verify Workspace IAM

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Verify in Bytebase:

1. Go to **IAM & Admin > Members**
2. Check user roles:
   - **admin@example.com**: Workspace Admin
   - **tf@service.bytebase.com**: Workspace Admin
   - **dba@example.com**, **dba2@example.com**: Workspace DBA
   - **dev1-3@example.com**, **qa1-2@example.com**: Workspace Member
3. Note that QA Team group has Project Viewer role for ALL projects

![members](/content/docs/tutorials/manage-database-access-control-with-terraform/bb-members.webp)

### Step 4 - Configure Project IAM Policy

Add the following project IAM policy to your `5-user-iam.tf` file. These roles only apply to `Project Two`, however, the project roles defined in workspace level will show in both `Project One` and `Project Two`:

```hcl
resource "bytebase_iam_policy" "project_iam" {
  depends_on = [
    bytebase_group.developers,
    bytebase_user.workspace_dba1,
    bytebase_user.workspace_dba2
  ]

  parent = bytebase_project.project-two.name

  iam_policy {

    binding {
      role = "roles/projectOwner"
      members = [
        format("user:%s", bytebase_user.workspace_dba1.email),
        format("user:%s", bytebase_user.workspace_dba2.email)
      ]
    }

    binding {
      role = "roles/projectDeveloper"
      members = [
        "allUsers",
        format("group:%s", bytebase_group.developers.email)
      ]
    }

    binding {
      role = "roles/sqlEditorUser"
      members = [
        format("group:%s", bytebase_group.developers.email)
      ]
      condition {
        database         = "instances/prod-sample-instance/databases/hr_prod"
        schema           = "public"
        tables           = ["employee", "salary"]
        expire_timestamp = "2027-07-10T16:17:49Z"
      }
    }

  }
}
```

#### Apply and Verify Project IAM

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Verify in Bytebase:

1. Go to **Project One** > **Manage > Members**:

   - QA Team: Project Viewer (inherited from workspace)
   - Terraform Service Account: Project Owner (as creator)

   ![project-1-members](/content/docs/tutorials/manage-database-access-control-with-terraform/bb-project-1-members.webp)

1. Go to **Project Two** > **Manage > Members**:

   - QA Team: Project Viewer (inherited from workspace)
   - DBA users: Project Owner
   - All users + Developer Team: Project Developer
   - Developer Team: SQL Editor User (click edit to see table restrictions)

   ![project-2-members](/content/docs/tutorials/manage-database-access-control-with-terraform/bb-project-2-members.webp)

   ![project-2-sql-editor-user](/content/docs/tutorials/manage-database-access-control-with-terraform/bb-project-2-sql-editor-user.webp)

### Step 5 - Test Access Control

Test the access control configuration:

1. **Set a password for Developer 1**:

   - Go to **IAM & Admin > Users & Groups**
   - Find and click on **Developer 1**
   - Click **Edit** and set a password

   ![dev1-pw](/content/docs/tutorials/manage-database-access-control-with-terraform/bb-dev1-pw.webp)

1. **Log in as Developer 1** in a new browser/incognito window:

   - You should only see **Project Two** (not Project One)
   - Navigate to **SQL Editor**

1. **Test SQL Editor restrictions**:

   - Connect to `Prod > Prod Sample Instance > hr_prod`
   - Try querying `employee` table - ✅ Should work
   - Try querying `salary` table - ✅ Should work
   - Try querying `department` table - ❌ Should fail with permission error

   ![sql-editor-department](/content/docs/tutorials/manage-database-access-control-with-terraform/bb-sql-editor-department.webp)

## Access Control Patterns

The example demonstrates several key patterns:

1. **User Types**: Regular users (`USER`) and service accounts (`SERVICE_ACCOUNT`)
2. **Group Management**: Groups with owners and members for team organization
3. **Workspace Roles**: Admin, DBA, and Member roles at workspace level
4. **Project Roles**: Owner and Developer roles at project level
5. **Conditional Access**: Time-limited, table-specific SQL Editor permissions

## Key Points

- **IAM Hierarchy**: Workspace policies apply globally, project policies are scoped to specific projects
- **Project Roles at Workspace Level**: When assigned in workspace IAM, project roles (like `projectViewer`) apply to ALL projects
- **Group Benefits**: Manage permissions for teams rather than individuals
- **Conditional Bindings**: Fine-grained access control down to table level with expiration
- **Role Inheritance**: Higher roles include permissions of lower roles
