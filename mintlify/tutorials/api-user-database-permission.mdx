In our [previous tutorial](/tutorials/api-issue), we demonstrated how to create a schema change using the Bytebase API. This tutorial will focus on inspect user and database permissions in Bytebase, it's OK if you haven't gone through the previous tutorial.

By following this guide, you'll learn how to:

- Set up and configure API access.
- For a given database, which users have been granted permissions?
- For a given user, which databases have been granted permissions?

## Repository

https://github.com/bytebase/example-api/tree/main/permission-check

## Prerequisites

1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed
1. Node.js >= v18

## Start Bytebase

<StartBytebase />

## Create Service Account

<CreateServiceAccount />

## Run Demo

1. Go to [Bytebase API Example
   repo](https://github.com/bytebase/example-api) and clone it.

1. Copy `env-template.local` to `.env.local`.Update the variables.

   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BB_URL`: `http://localhost:8080`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BB_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`: `api-example`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BB_SERVICE_KEY`: service key copied in previous step

1. Go to subfolder `permission-check`, and run the following commands to start the demo application.

   ```bash
   pnpm i && pnpm dev
   ```

1. Open the demo in your browser, you'll see the following page.
   ![api-permission-home](/content/docs/tutorials/api-user-database-permission/api-permission-demo.webp)

1. To enhance the demo's realism, go to Bytebase and add more users and set up user permissions:
   - Add new users in **Security & Policy > Users & Groups**
   - Grant roles:
     - For workspace-level access: **Security & Policy > Members & Roles**
     - For project-specific access: Navigate to a project and use **Manage > Members**

## Inspect Permissions

### Database + Permission => Users

The left side form demonstrates a scenario where you have a **database** and want to inspect who has access to it. This is useful for continuously tracking access to sensitive databases and ensuring only authorized users have permissions.
![demo-db-user](/content/docs/tutorials/api-user-database-permission/demo-db-user.webp)

Let's dig into the code:

1. In `page.tsx`, we fetch all roles by calling the [/v1/roles](https://api.bytebase.com/#tag/roleservice/GET/v1/roles) API before any user selection.

1. In `db-fetch-user-permission.tsx`, after the user selects a **project**, **database**, and **permission**, we filter the roles with the given permission:

   ```javascript
   const rolesWithPermission = allRoles.filter((role) => role.permissions.includes(permission));
   ```

1. Bytebase has two levels of Identity Access Management (IAM): **Workspace** and **Project**. We fetch both:

   - Workspace-level IAM: [/v1/workspaces/\*:getIamPolicy](https://api.bytebase.com/#tag/workspaceservice/GET/v1/workspaces/{workspace}:getIamPolicy) API
   - Project-level IAM: [/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID:getIamPolicy](https://api.bytebase.com/#tag/projectservice/GET/v1/projects/{project}:getIamPolicy) API

   The IAM object structure varies slightly between levels. Here's an example of a workspace-level IAM:

   ```json
   {
     "role": "roles/workspaceDBA",
     "members": [
       "user:api-sample@service.bytebase.com",
       "user:a@bytebase.com",
       "user:admin2@x.com"
     ],
     "condition": {
       "expression": "",
       "title": "",
       "description": "",
       "location": ""
     },
     "parsedExpr": null
   }
   ```

1. We compare the roles with the given IAM to find matches:

   ```javascript
   rolesWithPermission.some((role) => role.name === iam.role);
   ```

1. Some project-level IAM objects include a `condition` field for fine-grained access control. For example:

   ```json
   {
     "role": "roles/sqlEditorUser",
     "members": ["user:dev@x.com", "user:dev2@x.com"],
     "condition": {
       "expression": "(resource.database in [\"instances/test-sample-instance/databases/hr_test\"])",
       "title": "SQL Editor User hr_prod",
       "description": "",
       "location": ""
     }
   }
   ```

   This grants the `SQL Editor User` role only for the `hr_test` database in `test-sample-instance`.

1. When processing IAM policies, handle [CEL (Common Expression Language)](https://cel.dev/) format conditions carefully. In this demo, we parse these conditions using a custom `parseCelExpression` function:

   ```javascript
   const celValue = await parseCelExpression(iam.condition.expression);
   ```

   This function `parseCelExpression`, adapted from Bytebase's [CEL plugin](https://github.com/bytebase/bytebase/tree/main/frontend/src/plugins/cel) and [cel.ts](https://github.com/bytebase/bytebase/blob/main/frontend/src/utils/issue/cel.ts), parses the condition expression string. It is primarily based on the `convertFromCELString` function in [cel.ts](https://github.com/bytebase/bytebase/blob/main/frontend/src/utils/issue/cel.ts), though you could use `convertFromExpr` to create your own. The function returns an array of database resources with their associated expiration times. This function and related CEL parsing logic are implemented in a custom `plugins/cel` folder within the demo project.

1. We then check if the conditions are met for the specific database:

   ```javascript
   for (let dbrs of celValue.databaseResources) {
     if (dbrs.databaseName == database) {
       return iam.members.map((member) => ({ member, expiredTime }));
     }
   }
   ```

1. The `members` array may include both users and groups. To handle groups, use the [v1/groups](https://api.bytebase.com/#tag/groupservice/GET/v1/groups) API:

   ```json
   {
      "role": "roles/projectQuerier",
      "members": ["user:dev2@x.com", "group:bbbb@x.com"],
      ...
   }
   ```

By following these steps, you can effectively determine which users have access to a specific database, taking into account both direct user assignments and group memberships, as well as any conditional access rules.

### User + Permission => Databases

The right side form demonstrates a scenario where you have a **user** and want to inspect which databases they have access to. This is useful for ongoing tracking of user permissions, especially when roles change or users leave the company.

![demo-user-db](/content/docs/tutorials/api-user-database-permission/demo-user-db.webp)

1. Fetch all roles using the [/v1/roles](https://api.bytebase.com/#tag/roleservice/GET/v1/roles) API in `page.tsx`.

1. In `user-fetch-db-permission.tsx`, filter roles based on the selected permission:

   ```javascript
   const rolesWithPermission = allRoles.filter((role) => role.permissions.includes(permission));
   ```

1. Fetch and compare workspace-level and project-level IAM policies:

   - Workspace-level check:

   ```javascript
   const hasUserWorkspacePermission = (rolesWithPermission, rolesToBeMatched) => {
     if (rolesToBeMatched.length === 0) return false;
     return rolesToBeMatched.some((roleToBeMatched) =>
       rolesWithPermission.some(
         (roleWithPermission) =>
           roleWithPermission.name === roleToBeMatched.role &&
           roleToBeMatched.members.includes(`user:${user}`),
       ),
     );
   };
   ```

   - Project-level check:

   ```javascript
   for (const project of allProjects) {
     const projectIamData = await fetchData(
       `/api/projectiam/${encodeURIComponent(project.name.split('/')[1])}`,
     );
     const userHasMatchedRoles = getUserProjectPermissionRoles(
       rolesWithPermission,
       projectIamData.bindings,
       userGroups.length > 0,
       project.name,
     );
     // ... process matched roles
   }
   ```

1. Handle CEL conditions:

   ```javascript
   if (role.condition && role.condition.expression === '') {
     userHasFullProjectPermission = true;
   } else {
     const celValue = await parseCelExpression(role.condition.expression);
     celsConverted.push(celValue);
   }
   ```

1. Group should be taken into consideration too.

   ```javascript
   return refinedRolesToBeMatched.filter((roleToBeMatched) => {
     const memberMatch = roleToBeMatched.members.includes(`user:${user}`);
     const groupMatch =
       hasGroups &&
       userGroups.some((group) =>
         roleToBeMatched.members.includes(group.replace('groups/', 'group:')),
       );
     return memberMatch || groupMatch;
   });
   ```

By following these steps, you can effectively identify all databases a specific user has access to, taking into account various permission levels and conditions.

## Summary

Congratulations! You've successfully created a user and database permission inspection tool using the Bytebase API. This allows you to:

1. Inspect which users have access to specific databases.
1. Inspect which databases a particular user can access.

By leveraging these API calls within existing DevOps platforms, organizations can improve their database access governance and security posture.
