Bytebase offers multiple features to simplify batch change management. In this tutorial, we will guide you on how to configure **Environment** and **Database Group** to batch change databases for various scenarios.

## Preparation

1. Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed, and if you donâ€™t have important existing Bytebase data locally, you can start over from scratch by `rm -rf ~/.bytebase/data`.

1. **Environment** is a **Community Plan** feature and **Database group** is an **Pro Plan** feature, you need to have a valid license to enable it. You can request a trial license key from [here](https://bytebase.com/pricing).

## Procedure

### Step 1 - Start Bytebase and prepare the environments

To demonstrate the batch change, we need to prepare some databases first.

1. Copy and paste the commands to start one Bytebase via Docker.

   <TerminalDockerRunVolume />

1. Regsiter an admin account and it will be granted the `workspace admin` role automatically.

1. Go to **Environments**, update the existing `Prod` environment to `ProdAsia` and then create two new environments `ProdEU` and `ProdNA`.

### Step 2 - Create databases

1. Bytebase provides two sample PostgreSQL instances. Click `Select Project` on the top bar, and click **New Project** on the popup. Fill it with a name `batch project` and create **Create**.

1. Go into project `batch change`, click **Database > Databases** on the left side bar. There is no databases belonging to this project yet. Click **New DB**. To mimic the real-world scenario, firstly, create `demo-test` which should be created on sample test instance. An issue will be created automatically, click **Rollout**. After the issue is done, the database is created.

   ![bb-issue-test-done](/content/docs/tutorials/batch-change-with-database-group/bb-issue-test-done.webp)

1. In the same way, create `demo-prod-1` and `demo-prod-2` which should be created on `ProdAsia` environment. `demo-prod-3` and `demo-prod-4` should be created on `ProdEU` environment. `demo-prod-5` and `demo-prod-6` should be created on `ProdNA` environment.

### Step 3 - Batch change by environment (Community Plan)

1. Go to **Databases > Database** in the project, select `demo-test` and `demo-prod-1`~`demo-prod-6` and click **Edit Schema**.

   ![bb-edit-schema](/content/docs/tutorials/batch-change-with-database-group/bb-edit-schema.webp)

1. Fill in a SQL and click **Create**. You can see the pipeline has four stages - Test, ProdAsia, ProdEU, and ProdNA. You may select the stage and choose either rollout change to the current database or the current stage.

   ```SQL
      CREATE TABLE t2("id" INTEGER NOT NULL);
   ```

   ![bb-half-rollout](/content/docs/tutorials/batch-change-with-database-group/bb-half-rollout.webp)

1. After all the databases are rolled out, you can see the issue is done.

### Step 4 - Database group (Pro/Enterprise Plan)

We need first to upgrade to Pro/Enterprise Plan to use Database Group.

1. Click the **Setting icon** on the top right, and then click **Workspace > Subscription** to upload the license.

1. Click the pen icon, select the instances you want to enable Enterprise features , and click **Confirm**.

   ![bb-subscription](/content/docs/tutorials/data-rollback/bb-subscription.webp)

1. Go to **Database > Groups** in the project, click **New database group**, fill the fields as follows, when you scroll down, you will see there's an option **Multitennancy**, keep it unchecked for now and click **Save**.

   - **Name:** `demo-prod-all`
   - **Condition:** `resource.database_name startsWith demo-prod`

   ![bb-groups](/content/docs/tutorials/batch-change-with-database-group/bb-groups.webp)

1. Go to **Database > Groups** in the project, click **Change > Edit Schema**.

   ![bb-group-change](/content/docs/tutorials/batch-change-with-database-group/bb-group-change.webp)

1. You many see the six databases in three stages. Fill in the SQLs and click **Create**.

   ```SQL
      CREATE TABLE t3("id" INTEGER NOT NULL);
   ```

## Summary

Now you have learned how to configure environment and database group to run batch changes in Bytebase.
