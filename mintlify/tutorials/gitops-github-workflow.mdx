This is part of our database GitOps series with Bytebase:

- Database GitOps with GitHub Actions (this one)
- [Database GitOps with Azure DevOps Pipeline](/tutorials/gitops-azure-devops-workflow)
- [Database GitOps with GitLab CI](/tutorials/gitops-gitlab-workflow)
- [Database GitOps with Bitbucket Pipelines](/tutorials/gitops-bitbucket-workflow)

This tutorial shows you how to build an database GitOps workflow using GitHub Actions and Bytebase API. You'll learn to:

1. Create a streamlined database release workflow where you can:

   - Submit schema migrations through GitHub
   - Automatically run SQL reviews on pull requests
   - Auto-create and deploy Bytebase releases when merging to `main`

2. Manually control rollouts by stage

3. Deploy changes via ChatOps-style PR comments

<Info>

While we use PostgreSQL with GitHub Actions in this guide, you can apply these concepts to other SQL or NoSQL databases with any CI platforms like GitLab CI, Bitbucket Pipelines, or Azure DevOps using the Bytebase API.

## Repository

https://github.com/bytebase/example-gitops-github-flow

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed
- An [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) account

## Automatic Rollout across environments

### Step 1 - Start Bytebase with ngrok

<StartWithNgrok />

### Step 2 - Create Service Account

<CreateServiceAccountGitOps />

### Step 3 - Configure SQL Review in Bytebase

<ConfigSQLReview />

### Step 4 - Fork the Example Repository and Configure Variables

1. Fork [https://github.com/bytebase/example-gitops-github-flow](https://github.com/bytebase/example-gitops-github-flow). There are three workflows in this repository:

   - `.github/workflows/sql-review-action.yml`: [Lint the SQL](/sql-review/review-policy/) migration files after the PR is created.
   - `.github/workflows/release-action.yml`: Create a release in Bytebase after the PR is merged to the `main` branch.
   - `.github/workflows/chatops-migrate.yml`: Deploy changes to specific environments via PR comments using `/migrate` command.

1. Go into `.github/workflows/release-action.yml` and `.github/workflows/sql-review-action.yml`. In the `env` section, replace the variable values with your own and commit the changes.

   - **BYTEBASE_URL**: your ngrok url
   - **BYTEBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT**: `api-example@service.bytebase.com` (the service account you created in the previous step)
   - **BYTEBASE_PROJECT**: `projects/project-sample` (the sample project in the Bytebase)
   - **BYTEBASE_TARGETS**: `instances/test-sample-instance/databases/hr_test,instances/prod-sample-instance/databases/hr_prod` (the two default databases in the sample project)
   - **FILE_PATTERN**: `migrations-semver/*.sql` (the pattern of the migration files)

1. You may paste the password of the service account you created in the previous step directly after **service-secret** or keep the **service-secret** value as `${{secrets.BYTEBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET}}`. Go to **Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions**, click **New repository secret**, and add **BYTEBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET**.

1. In `.github/workflows/sql-review-action.yml`, the **`GITHUB_TOKEN`** (`${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`) is included to allow the workflow to comment on pull requests with the `Check release` results. You donâ€™t need to configure it manually â€” GitHub provides it automatically during workflow execution.

1. Go to **Actions** tab, enable actions workflow run.

### Step 5 - Create the migration files

To create migration files to trigger release creation, the files have to match the following pattern:

- A migration file should start with digits, which is also its version. e.g. `202503131500_create_table_t1_ddl.sql`, you can also use semantic versioning like `1.0.0_create_table_t1_ddl.sql`.
- A migration file may end with 'ddl' or 'dml' to indicate its change type. If it doesn't end with any of the two, its change type is DDL by default.

1. Within your forked repository, create the following migration files under `migrations` directory:

   - 202503131500_create_table_t1_ddl.sql

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE t1 (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT
   );
   ```

1. Commit to a new branch and create a pull request, the `sql-review-action` workflow will be triggered. There will be a warning in the SQL review result. Go into the **File changes** tab, you can see the warning.

   ![gh-sql-review-warning](/content/docs/tutorials/gitops-github-workflow/gh-sql-review-warning.webp)

   ![gh-warning-file](/content/docs/tutorials/gitops-github-workflow/gh-warning-file.webp)

1. According to the SQL review result, you can do some changes to the SQL files and push to the branch. Then you should see the SQL review has passed. There are no warnings in the SQL review result.

   ```sql
    CREATE TABLE t1 (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL
   );
   ```

   ![gh-sql-review-pass](/content/docs/tutorials/gitops-github-workflow/gh-sql-review-pass.webp)

1. When the SQL review is passed, you can merge the pull request. The `release-action` workflow will be triggered to create a **release** in Bytebase and then deploy automatically. Go to **Actions** tab, you can see the workflow run and pass.
   ![gh-merge-run](/content/docs/tutorials/gitops-github-workflow/gh-merge-run.webp)

1. Click into the workflow run, you can see the release is created in Bytebase and the rollout is applied to the databases automatically.

   ![gh-deploy-automatic](/content/docs/tutorials/gitops-github-workflow/gh-deploy-automatic.webp)

1. If you click the test stage and expand the different sections, you can follow the links to Bytebase.

   ![gh-deploy-to-test-expand](/content/docs/tutorials/gitops-github-workflow/gh-deploy-to-test-expand.webp)

   ![bb-rollout](/content/docs/tutorials/gitops-github-workflow/bb-rollout.webp)

## Manual Rollout by Environment

In the previous section, once the PR is merged, we create a release and deploy it to both test and prod environments automatically.
You can also manually control the rollout by stage.

1. In the repo, click **Settings** > **Environments**, choose **Prod**. Here you can add **required reviewers** for the stage and also set **wait timer**.
   ![gh-config-prod](/content/docs/tutorials/gitops-github-workflow/gh-config-prod.webp)

1. Create a new branch with this file, and create a pull request. Merge it to the `main` branch.

   - 202503131530_create_table_t2_ddl.sql

   ```sql
       CREATE TABLE t2 (
         id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
         name TEXT NOT NULL
      );
   ```

1. Go to the **Actions** tab, you can see the workflow run and stop at the Prod stage.

   ![gh-waiting](/content/docs/tutorials/gitops-github-workflow/gh-waiting.webp)

1. Wait for 5 minutes, the workflow will wait for the required reviewers to approve.

   ![gh-waiting-finish](/content/docs/tutorials/gitops-github-workflow/gh-waiting-finish.webp)

1. Click **Approve and deploy** button, the workflow will continue to rollout to the Prod stage.

   ![gh-approve-deploy](/content/docs/tutorials/gitops-github-workflow/gh-approve-deploy.webp)

   ![gh-deploy](/content/docs/tutorials/gitops-github-workflow/gh-deploy.webp)

   ![gh-deploy-finish](/content/docs/tutorials/gitops-github-workflow/gh-deploy-finish.webp)

## ChatOps Deployment via PR Comments

In addition to automatic and manual deployments, you can also deploy database changes to any environment directly from pull request comments using ChatOps commands.

Team members can trigger deployments by commenting `/migrate <environment>` on any pull request. The workflow will:
1. Validate the command and environment
2. Create a rollout plan in Bytebase
3. Execute the migration to the specified environment
4. Report the results back in the PR comments

### Step 1 - Configure ChatOps Workflow

1. Go into `.github/workflows/chatops-migrate.yml`. In the `env` section, replace the variable values with your own:

   - **BYTEBASE_URL**: your ngrok url
   - **BYTEBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT**: `api-example@service.bytebase.com`
   - **BYTEBASE_PROJECT**: `projects/project-sample`
   - **FILE_PATTERN**: `migrations-semver/*.sql`

2. In the same workflow file, modify the config generation step to match your environments:

   ```yml
   - name: Write command config
     run: |
       cat <<EOF > ${{ runner.temp }}/bytebase-action-config.yaml
       test:
         stage: environments/test
         targets:
           - instances/test-sample-instance/databases/hr_test
       prod:
         stage: environments/prod
         targets:
           - instances/prod-sample-instance/databases/hr_prod
       EOF
   ```

3. Set your service account password in the repository secrets setting with the name `BYTEBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET`.

4. In **Settings > Environments**, ensure you have environments matching your config (e.g., "test", "prod"). For production, configure deployment protection rules if needed.

### Step 2 - Deploy via PR Comments

1. Create a new branch with this file and create a pull request:

   - 1.14.0_code.sql

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS code VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT '';
   ```

2. After the SQL review passes, comment `/migrate test` on the PR to deploy to test environment.

   ![gh-chatops-test](/content/docs/tutorials/gitops-github-workflow/gh-chatops-test.webp)

3. The workflow will add a ðŸš€ reaction and post deployment progress in the PR comments.

   ![gh-chatops-progress](/content/docs/tutorials/gitops-github-workflow/gh-chatops-progress.webp)

4. When deployment completes, you'll see a success message with links to Bytebase resources.

   ![gh-chatops-success](/content/docs/tutorials/gitops-github-workflow/gh-chatops-success.webp)

5. To deploy to production, comment `/migrate prod`. If production requires approval, the workflow will wait for reviewers.

## Summary

Now you have learned how to implement database GitOps with GitHub Actions in three ways:

1. **Automatic deployment** after merging to main branch
2. **Manual rollout** with environment-level approval
3. **ChatOps deployment** via PR comments for pre-merge testing

If you want to trigger a release creation with other git providers (e.g. GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps), you may customize the workflow file.
