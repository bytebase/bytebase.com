This is part of our database GitOps series with Bytebase:

- Database GitOps with GitHub Actions (this one)
- [Database GitOps with Azure DevOps Pipeline](/tutorials/gitops-azure-devops-workflow)
- Database GitOps with GitLab CI (TBD)

---

This tutorial shows you how to build an database GitOps workflow using GitHub Actions and Bytebase API. You'll learn to:

1. Create a streamlined database release workflow where you can:

   - Submit schema migrations through GitHub
   - Automatically run SQL reviews on pull requests
   - Auto-create and deploy Bytebase releases when merging to `main`

2. Manually control rollouts by stage

<HintBlock type="info">

While we use PostgreSQL with GitHub Actions in this guide, you can apply these concepts to other SQL or NoSQL databases with any CI platforms like GitLab CI, Bitbucket Pipelines, or Azure DevOps using the Bytebase API.

## Repository

https://github.com/bytebase/example-gitops-github-flow

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed
- An [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) account

## Automatic Rollout across environments

### Step 1 - Start Bytebase with ngrok

<IncludeBlock url="/docs/get-started/install/vcs-with-ngrok"></IncludeBlock>

### Step 2 - Create Service Account

<IncludeBlock url="/docs/share/tutorials/create-service-account-gitops"></IncludeBlock>

### Step 3 - Configure SQL Review in Bytebase

<IncludeBlock url="/docs/share/tutorials/config-sql-review"></IncludeBlock>

### Step 4 - Fork the Example Repository and Configure Variables

1. Fork [https://github.com/bytebase/example-gitops-github-flow](https://github.com/bytebase/example-gitops-github-flow). There are two workflows in this repository:

   - `.github/workflows/sql-review.yml`: [Lint the SQL](/sql-review/overview/) migration files after the PR is created.
   - `.github/workflows/release.yml`: Create a release in Bytebase after the PR is merged to the `main` branch.

1. Go into `.github/workflows/release.yml` and `.github/workflows/sql-review.yml`. In the `env` section, replace the variable values with your own and commit the changes.

   - **BYTEBASE_URL**: your ngrok url
   - **BYTEBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT**: `api-example@service.bytebase.com` (the service account you created in the previous step)
   - **BYTEBASE_PROJECT**: `projects/project-sample` (the sample project in the Bytebase)
   - **BYTEBASE_TARGETS**: `instances/test-sample-instance/databases/hr_test,instances/prod-sample-instance/databases/hr_prod` (the two default databases in the sample project)
   - **FILE_PATTERN**: `migrations/*.sql` (the pattern of the migration files)

1. You may paste the password of the service account you created in the previous step directly after **service-secret** or keep the **service-secret** value as `${{secrets.BYTEBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET}}`. Go to **Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions**, click **New repository secret**, and add **BYTEBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET**.

1. Go to **Actions** tab, enable actions workflow run.

### Step 5 - Create the migration files

To create migration files to trigger release creation, the files have to match the following pattern:

- A migration file should start with digits, which is also its version. e.g. `202503131500_create_table_t1_ddl.sql`.
- A migration file may end with 'ddl' or 'dml' to indicate its change type. If it doesn't end with any of the two, its change type is DDL by default.

1. Within your forked repository, create the following migration files under `migrations` directory:

   - 202503131500_create_table_t1_ddl.sql

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE t1 (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT
   );
   ```

1. Commit to a new branch and create a pull request, the `sql-review` workflow will be triggered. There will be a warning in the SQL review result. Go into the **File changes** tab, you can see the warning.

   ![gh-sql-review-warning](/content/docs/tutorials/gitops-github-workflow/gh-sql-review-warning.webp)

   ![gh-warning-file](/content/docs/tutorials/gitops-github-workflow/gh-warning-file.webp)

1. According to the SQL review result, you can do some changes to the SQL files and push to the branch. Then you should see the SQL review has passed. There are no warnings in the SQL review result.

   ```sql
    CREATE TABLE t1 (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL
   );
   ```

   ![gh-sql-review-pass](/content/docs/tutorials/gitops-github-workflow/gh-sql-review-pass.webp)

1. When the SQL review is passed, you can merge the pull request. The `release` workflow will be triggered to create a **release** in Bytebase and then roll out automatically. Go to **Actions** tab, you can see the workflow run and pass.

   ![gh-merge-run](/content/docs/tutorials/gitops-github-workflow/gh-merge-run.webp)

1. Click into the workflow run, you can see the release is created in Bytebase and the rollout is applied to the databases automatically.

   ![gh-deploy-automatic](/content/docs/tutorials/gitops-github-workflow/gh-deploy-automatic.webp)

1. If you click the test stage and expand the different sections, you can follow the links to Bytebase.

### Breakdown of the GitHub Actions Workflow

1. Check out your repo and log in to Bytebase to gain the access token.

   ```yaml
   - name: Checkout
     uses: actions/checkout@v4
   - name: Login to Bytebase
     id: login
     uses: bytebase/login-action@v1
     with:
       bytebase-url: ${{ env.BYTEBASE_URL }}
       service-key: ${{ env.BYTEBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT }}
       service-secret: ${{ secrets.BYTEBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET} }}
   ```

1. The **create-release** step scans the files matching the pattern and collects them into a bundle. Note that these files should also obey the naming scheme mentioned above.

   The bundle is first sent for check. Because we set `FAIL_ON_ERROR`, the release will be created in Bytebase only when the check passes.

   ```yaml
   - name: Create release
     id: create-release
     uses: bytebase/create-release-action@v1
     with:
       bytebase-url: ${{ env.BYTEBASE_URL }}
       service-key: ${{ env.BYTEBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT }}
       service-secret: ${{ secrets.BYTEBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET }}
       file-pattern: ${{ env.FILE_PATTERN }}
       check-release: 'FAIL_ON_ERROR'
       project: ${{ env.BYTEBASE_PROJECT }}
       targets: ${{ env.BYTEBASE_TARGETS }}
       validate-only: 'false'
   ```

1. Create a rollout and wait for completion.

   ```yaml
   - name: Create plan
        id: create-plan
        uses: bytebase/create-plan-from-release-action@v1
        with:
          url: ${{ env.BYTEBASE_URL }}
          token: ${{ steps.login.outputs.token }}
          project: ${{ env.BYTEBASE_PROJECT }}
          release: ${{ steps.create-release.outputs.release }}
          targets: ${{ env.BYTEBASE_TARGETS }}
          check-plan: "SKIP"

    - name: Rollout
        id: rollout
        uses: bytebase/rollout-action@v2
        if: ${{ steps.create-plan.outputs.deployment-required == 'true' }}
        with:
          url: ${{ env.BYTEBASE_URL }}
          token: ${{ steps.login.outputs.token }}
          plan: ${{ steps.create-plan.outputs.plan }}
          target-stage: environments/test # the stage environment.

   - name: Deploy app
        run: |
          echo "Deploying app to test environment..."
          echo "Deploy app to test environment done!"
   ```

   These are the steps:

   - Create the plan from the release
   - Create the rollout
   - Wait for the rollout to complete

## Manual Rollout by Environment

In the previous section, once the PR is merged, we create a release and roll out it to both test and prod environments automatically.
You can also manually control the rollout by stage.

1. In the repo, click **Settings** > **Environments**, choose **Prod**. Here you can add **required reviewers** for the stage and also set **wait timer**.
   ![gh-config-prod](/content/docs/tutorials/gitops-github-workflow/gh-config-prod.webp)

1. Create a new branch with this file, and create a pull request. Merge it to the `main` branch.

   - 202503131530_create_table_t2_ddl.sql

   ```sql
       CREATE TABLE t2 (
         id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
         name TEXT NOT NULL
      );
   ```

1. Go to the **Actions** tab, you can see the workflow run and stop at the Prod stage.

   ![gh-waiting](/content/docs/tutorials/gitops-github-workflow/gh-waiting.webp)

1. Wait for 5 minutes, the workflow will wait for the required reviewers to approve.

   ![gh-waiting-finish](/content/docs/tutorials/gitops-github-workflow/gh-waiting-finish.webp)

1. Click **Approve and deploy** button, the workflow will continue to rollout to the Prod stage.

   ![gh-approve-deploy](/content/docs/tutorials/gitops-github-workflow/gh-approve-deploy.webp)

   ![gh-deploy](/content/docs/tutorials/gitops-github-workflow/gh-deploy.webp)

   ![gh-deploy-finish](/content/docs/tutorials/gitops-github-workflow/gh-deploy-finish.webp)

## Summary

Now you have learned how to database GitOps with GitHub Action. If you want to trigger a release creation with other git providers (e.g. GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps), you may customize the workflow file.
