When modifying data in the database, it's crucial to ensure that the changes are both safe and accurate. Bytebase offers a feature called [SQL Review](/sql-review/review-policy/), which allows you to evaluate your SQL changes before they are applied to the database. SQL Review can be invoked from the Bytebase GUI, CI or API.

This is one of the tutorial series of SQL Review:

1.  [Codify SQL Review Policies with Bytebase API](/tutorials/api-sql-review-policy/)

This tutorial will walk you through using SQL Review in Bytebase with Bytebase API to improve your database schema change process. The **Community Plan** is sufficient for completing this tutorial.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have completed the previous tutorial [SQL Review with Bytebase GUI](/tutorials/sql-review-gui/).

If you want to test the SQL Review API locally, you may need to configure ngrok.
