In this tutorial, you'll use the default sample databases to get familiar with the product in the quickest way.

## Step 1 - Run via Docker and Setup

<PreparationWithSampleData />

## Step 2 - Configure the SQL Review

1. Navigate to **CI/CD** > **SQL Review** in the left menu. Click **+ New SQL Review** to create a new SQL review.

1. Choose `Sample Template` which has 20 enabled rules and click **Confirm and add**. Attach the SQL review to Environment `Prod` and click **Confirm**.

1. You'll see the SQL review is created.

## Step 3 - Create a Plan

1. Navigate to **CI/CD** > **Plans** in the left menu and click **+ New Plan**.
   ![new-plan](/content/docs/change-database/plan/bb-new-plan.webp)

1. Select **Schema Migration (DDL)** as the change type.
   ![plan-change-type](/content/docs/change-database/plan/bb-plan-change-type.webp)

1. Select the databases where changes will be applied:
   - `hr_test` on `Test Sample instance` 
   - `hr_prod` on `Prod Sample instance`
   
   Click **Confirm** to proceed.
   ![plan-targets](/content/docs/change-database/plan/bb-plan-targets.webp)

1. Add the SQL statement:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE public.employee ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS nickname TEXT;
   ```
   
   Click **Create** to create the plan.

1. The plan will be in `Draft` status. You may see SQL review warnings, especially for the production environment. This is because Bytebase automatically runs configured checks.

## Step 4 - Review and Approve

1. To fix the SQL review warning, edit the SQL to add `NOT NULL DEFAULT ''`:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE public.employee ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS nickname TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '';
   ```
   
   Click **Save** to update the plan. The checks will run again and should pass.

1. Click **Ready for Review** and then **Confirm** to submit the plan for approval.

1. The plan has no approval required.

## Step 4 - Deploy the Changes

1. Navigate to the **Rollout** section. You'll see the deployment is ready for both Test and Prod environments.
   ![issue-2-targets-to-rollout](/content/docs/tutorials/first-schema-change/bb-issue-2-targets-to-rollout.webp)

1. Click **Run** for the Test stage first and then if it's successful, click **Run** for the Prod stage.

1. When all rollouts are successfully executed, the issue will be marked as `Done`.

## Next Step

Now you have successfully performed your first schema change, the core workflow in Bytebase. Next:

- If you want to move changes between environments, follow [How to Move Schema Change from Test to Prod](/tutorials/how-to-move-schema-change-from-test-to-prod/)
- If you want to rollout manually, follow [Deploy Schema Change with Rollout Policy](/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/).
- If you want to assign approvers before the rollout, follow [Database Change with Risk-Based Approval Flow](/tutorials/database-change-management-with-risk-adjusted-approval-flow/)
