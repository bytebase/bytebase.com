import TerminalDockerRunVolume from '/snippets/install/terminal-docker-run-volume.mdx';

In this tutorial, you'll use the default sample databases to get familiar with the product in the quickest way.

## Step 1 - Run via Docker

1. Install and start [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
1. Open Terminal to run the command:

   <TerminalDockerRunVolume />

1. Open Bytebase in [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/), fill in the fields and click **Create admin account**. You'll be redirected to Workspace.

1. You can click your avatar on top right and **Quickstart** from the dropdown menu.

## Step 2 - One Issue with Two Stages

1. Click **My Issues** on the left sidebar, and click the issue `SAM-101` which is created by default.
   ![issue](/content/docs/tutorials/first-schema-change/issue.webp)

1. The issue is `waiting for rollout`. There's a pipeline consisting of two stages:

   1. **Test Stage**: apply to database `hr_test` on `Test Sample instance`
   2. **Prod Stage**: apply to database `hr_prod` on `Prod Sample instance`

   `Test` stage is `active` by default.

   ![issue-test](/content/docs/tutorials/first-schema-change/issue-test.webp)

1. Click **Prod Stage** to switch to it, and you will see the two stages share the same SQL but to different databases. You may also notice there's a warning sign for SQL review on the `Prod` stage. That's because when the issue is created, Bytebase will run task checks automatically.
   ![issue-prod](/content/docs/tutorials/first-schema-change/issue-prod.webp)

1. Click the warning sign to see the details. If you wonder why only `Prod` stage has the warning sign, it's because by default SQL Review is only configured for `Prod` environment.

## Step 3 - Deploy on Test Stage

1. Switch back to **Test Stage** and click **Rollout**. Click **Rollout** on the confirmation dialog.

1. When the SQL is applied, there will be a checkmark on the **Test Stage**. Click **View change** and you'll see the change history diff.

   ![issue-snapshot-diff](/content/docs/tutorials/first-schema-change/issue-snapshot-diff.webp)

## Step 4 - Deploy on Prod Stage

There are two ways to deploy on **Prod Stage** regarding the SQL review result.

1. If you are confident with the SQL, you can click **Rollout** directly. Tick **Rollout anyway**, and click **Rollout** on the confirmation dialog.

1. Another way is to edit SQL. Click **Edit** on top of SQL block, add `NOT NULL`. It will be like:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE employee ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS email TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '';
   ```

   Click **Save**, the checks will be run again. This time the SQL review will pass. The issue will deploy and become `Done`.

   You may go to **Environments** to alter whether it rolls out automatically.

## Next Step

Now you have successfully performed your first schema change, the core workflow in Bytebase. Next:

- If you want to move changes between environments, follow [How to Move Schema Change from Test to Prod](/tutorials/how-to-move-schema-change-from-test-to-prod/)
- If you want to rollout manually, follow [Deploy Schema Change with Rollout Policy](/tutorials/deploy-schema-migration/).
- If you want to assign approvers before the rollout, follow [Database Change with Risk-Based Approval Flow](/tutorials/database-change-management-with-risk-adjusted-approval-flow/)
