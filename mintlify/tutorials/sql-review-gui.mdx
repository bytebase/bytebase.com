When modifying data in the database, it's crucial to ensure that the changes are both safe and accurate. Bytebase offers a feature called [SQL Review](/sql-review/overview/), which allows you to evaluate your SQL changes before they are applied to the database. SQL Review can be invoked from the Bytebase GUI, CI or API.

This is one of the tutorial series of SQL Review:

This tutorial will walk you through using SQL Review in Bytebase with Bytebase GUI to improve your database schema change process. The **Community Plan** is sufficient for completing this tutorial.

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed, and if you donâ€™t have important existing Bytebase data locally, you can start over from scratch by `rm -rf ~/.bytebase/data`.
1. Copy and paste the commands to start one Bytebase via Docker.

## Configure SQL Review Policies

1. Navigate to **CI/CD** > **SQL Review** in the left menu. Click **+ New SQL Review** to create a new SQL review.

1. Choose `Sample Template` which has 20 enabled rules and click **Confirm and add**. Attach the SQL review to Environment `Prod` and click **Confirm**.

1. You'll see the SQL review is created. Note that there's a warning sign for the `NOT NULL` rule.

## Trigger SQL Review

1. Go to `Sample Project`, navigate to **CI/CD** > **Plans** and click **+ New Plan**.

   ![new-plan](/content/docs/change-database/plan/bb-new-plan.webp)

1. Select **Schema Migration (DDL)** as the change type.

1. Select `hr_prod` database as the target since the default SQL Review policy is attached to the `Prod` environment. Click **Confirm** to proceed. You can use the **Schema Editor** to visually design the schema, here we'll intentionally uncheck **Not Null** for `nickname` column.

1. The plan will be in `Draft` status. SQL Review will run automatically, and you'll see violations against our defined rules marked in orange as `warning`.

   ![plan-draft-warning-detail](/content/docs/tutorials/sql-review-gui/bb-plan-draft-warning-detail.webp)

1. You may resolve this by editing the SQL to add `NOT NULL` constraints.Click **Save** to update the plan. The SQL Review checks will run again and should now pass.

## Summary

Now you have learned how to trigger SQL Review in Bytebase GUI, you may also refer to the [SQL Review](/sql-review/overview) document for more details. Next, let's learn how to [trigger SQL Review from your CI API](/tutorials/sql-review-api/).
