This tutorial is part of the **Bytebase Terraform Provider** series:

Part 1: [Manage Databases with Terraform](/tutorials/manage-databases-in-bytebase-with-terraform) - Set up instances and environments
Part 2: Manage Projects with Terraform (This one) - Organize databases into projects
Part 3: Configure Access Controls with Terraform (Coming next) - Set up IAM and permissions

ðŸ“š **Complete examples**: [GitHub - Bytebase Terraform Provider](https://github.com/bytebase/terraform-provider-bytebase/tree/main/examples)

In the [previous tutorial](/tutorials/manage-databases-in-bytebase-with-terraform), you learned how to manage database instances and environments with Terraform. Now let's organize those databases into projects for better management.

## What You'll Learn

Building on the previous tutorial, you'll learn how to:

- Create and manage projects to organize your databases
- Assign databases from instances to specific projects
- Use different patterns for database assignment
- Scale your project structure as your organization grows

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have completed the [Manage Databases with Terraform](/tutorials/manage-databases-in-bytebase-with-terraform) tutorial and have:

- Bytebase running with service account configured
- MySQL instances for Test and Prod environments
- Your existing `main.tf` file with the Terraform provider configured

## Understanding Projects in Bytebase

Projects in Bytebase help you organize databases logically.

<Note>
**Important**: You cannot create databases directly via Terraform because database creation requires an issue workflow in Bytebase. Terraform can only assign existing databases to projects. All database creation must be done through the Bytebase UI or API first.
</Note>

## Step 1 - Verify Your Database (Optional)

If you completed the previous tutorial, you should already have:

- A project called **Test**
- A database named `demo` on your `mysql-test` instance within this project

If you haven't created the `Test` project and `demo` database yet, create them via the Bytebase UI:

1. Login to Bytebase and click **Projects** on the left sidebar
1. Click **+ New Project** to create a project called `Test`
1. Navigate into the `Test` project you just created
1. Go to **Databases** and click **+ New DB**
1. Select your `mysql-test` instance and create a database named `demo`
1. **Complete the issue workflow** to create the database

You should have a database at `instances/mysql-test/databases/demo`.

## Step 2 - Query Current State (Optional)

You can add these lines to your `main.tf` to see all existing databases:

```hcl
# List all existing databases
data "bytebase_database_list" "all" {
  parent = "workspaces/-"
}

output "current_databases" {
  value = data.bytebase_database_list.all.databases
}
```

Run `terraform apply` to see your current databases and their projects.

## Step 3 - Create and Manage Projects

Now let's add the main feature of this tutorial - creating projects to organize your databases.

### Basic Project Creation

Add this new resource to your `main.tf` file:

```hcl
resource "bytebase_project" "another-project" {
  depends_on = [
    bytebase_instance.test
  ]
  resource_id = "another-project"
  title       = "Another project"
  
  # Assign specific databases from your instances
  databases = [
    # From test instance
    "instances/mysql-test/databases/demo"
  ]
}
```

This project resource:

- Creates a new project named `Another project` with ID `another-project`
- Assigns the `demo` database from your test instance to this project
- Depends on the test instance being created first
- Moves the database from the `Test` project to this new project

### Adding More Databases to Your Project

To add more databases to `another-project`:

1. Create additional databases via Bytebase UI in your instances
2. Update the project's databases list:

```hcl
resource "bytebase_project" "another-project" {
  depends_on = [
    bytebase_instance.test,
    bytebase_instance.prod
  ]
  resource_id = "another-project"
  title       = "Another project"
  
  databases = [
    "instances/mysql-test/databases/demo",
    "instances/mysql-test/databases/app_staging",
    "instances/mysql-prod/databases/app_prod"
  ]
}
```

### Creating Additional Projects

You can add more projects alongside the existing one:

```hcl
# Keep the existing project
resource "bytebase_project" "another-project" {
  # ... existing configuration
}

# Add a new project
resource "bytebase_project" "new-project" {
  depends_on = [
    bytebase_instance.prod
  ]
  resource_id = "new-project"
  title       = "New project"
  
  databases = [
    # Add production databases after creating them via UI
    # "instances/mysql-prod/databases/app_prod"
  ]
}
```

### Using All Databases from an Instance

You can also assign all databases from an instance:

```hcl
resource "bytebase_project" "test-apps" {
  depends_on = [
    bytebase_instance.test
  ]
  resource_id = "test-applications"
  title       = "Test Applications"
  
  # Assign all databases from the test instance
  databases = bytebase_instance.test.databases
}
```

## Step 4 - Deploy and Verify

1. **Apply the changes**:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

2. **Verify in Bytebase**:
   - Go to **Projects** in the sidebar
   - You should see `Another project` listed
   - Click into the project to see the `demo` database is assigned to it

## Best Practices

1. **Logical Organization**: Group databases by application, team, or business domain
2. **Environment Separation**: Consider separate projects for different environments if needed
3. **Access Control**: Use least privilege principle - grant minimal necessary permissions
4. **Naming Conventions**: Use consistent naming for projects and databases
5. **Documentation**: Keep project purposes and access patterns documented

## Summary

You've learned how to manage projects in Bytebase using Terraform. Starting from the existing configuration, you've:

- **Created a project** that organizes your `demo` database
- **Learned different patterns** for assigning databases to projects
- **Understood how to expand** by adding more databases and creating additional projects

## Next Steps

In the next tutorial, you'll learn how to:

- Configure project access controls with IAM bindings
- Set up role-based permissions for team members
- Implement security best practices

You can also explore:

- [Custom approval workflows](https://www.bytebase.com/docs/administration/custom-approval) for sensitive changes
- [Data masking policies](https://www.bytebase.com/docs/security/data-masking) for production data
- [Database branching](https://www.bytebase.com/docs/change-database/branch) for safer development
