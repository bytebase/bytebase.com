**File Structure**: This tutorial series uses separate Terraform files for better organization. Files are numbered by tutorial part and sub-step (e.g., `1-1-env.tf`, `1-2-instances.tf` for Part 1, `2-projects.tf` for Part 2, etc.). Terraform automatically handles dependencies between files.

Learn how to organize your databases into projects using Terraform and the [Terraform Bytebase Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/bytebase/bytebase/latest/docs).

<Note>

Bytebase Terraform Provider handles control plane configuration such as settings, policies, access controls. It does not
handle data plane operations such as database creation, schema migrations, DML execution, query.

</Note>

## What You'll Learn

- **Create** projects to organize your databases logically
- **Assign** existing databases to projects using Terraform
- **Apply** different patterns for database organization
- **Scale** your project structure efficiently

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:

- Completed [Part 1: Manage Databases with Terraform](/tutorials/manage-databases-in-bytebase-with-terraform)
- Bytebase running with ngrok and service account configured
- Database instances configured via Terraform
- Your Terraform files from the previous tutorial

## Setup

From Part 1, you should have:

- Two instances: `test-sample-instance` and `prod-sample-instance`
- Sample databases: `hr_test` and `hr_prod` created by Bytebase's built-in sample data

## Create Projects with Terraform

### Step 1 - Add Project Resources

Create `2-projects.tf` with the following project resources:

```hcl
# Project One - Assign all test databases
resource "bytebase_project" "project-one" {
  depends_on = [
    bytebase_instance.test
  ]
  resource_id = "project-one"
  title       = "Project One"

  databases = bytebase_instance.test.databases
}

# Project Two - Assign specific production database
resource "bytebase_project" "project-two" {
  depends_on = [
    bytebase_instance.prod
  ]
  resource_id = "project-two"
  title       = "Project Two"

  databases = [
    "instances/prod-sample-instance/databases/hr_prod"
  ]
}
```

### Step 2 - Apply Configuration

Run Terraform to create the project:

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Step 3 - Verify in Bytebase

1. Go to **Projects** in Bytebase, you should see **Project One** and **Project Two** listed.
1. **Project One** contains all databases from the test instance.

   ![project-1](/content/docs/tutorials/manage-projects-in-bytebase-with-terraform/bb-project-1.webp)

1. **Project Two** contains the `hr_prod` database from the production instance.

   ![project-2](/content/docs/tutorials/manage-projects-in-bytebase-with-terraform/bb-project-2.webp)

## Pattern Explanation

The example demonstrates two common patterns:

1. **Dynamic Assignment** (`Project One`): Uses `bytebase_instance.test.databases` to automatically include all databases from an instance. This is useful when you want all databases in an environment to belong to the same project.

2. **Explicit Assignment** (`Project Two`): Lists specific database paths like `"instances/prod-sample-instance/databases/hr_prod"`. This gives you precise control over which databases belong to a project.

## Key Points

- **Built-in Databases**: This tutorial uses the sample databases (`hr_test`, `hr_prod`) from Part 1
- **Database Assignment**: Projects can use dynamic assignment (all databases) or explicit paths
- **Dependencies**: Always depend on instance resources to ensure proper ordering

## Next Steps

**Continue the series:** [Manage Bytebase Settings with Terraform](/tutorials/manage-bytebase-settings-with-terraform) - configure workspace settings and policies.
