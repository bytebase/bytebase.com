## Overview

Bytebase uses RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to manage permissions. A **role** is a collection of permissions that can be granted to users and user groups.

### Permission Scope

Permissions in Bytebase apply to two levels of resources:

- **Workspace-level resources**: Settings, instances, environments, and overall workspace management
- **Project-level resources**: Project settings, databases, issues, and project-specific operations

### Role Types

Bytebase provides two types of roles:

#### Built-in Roles

**Workspace roles:**
- `Workspace Admin` - Full administrative control
- `Workspace DBA` - Database administration across all projects
- `Workspace Member` - Basic access (automatically assigned to all users)

**Project roles:**
- `Project Owner` - Full control over project resources
- `Project Developer` - Create and manage database changes
- `Project Releaser` - Approve and release changes
- `SQL Editor User` - Query databases (formerly `Project Querier`)
- `Project Exporter` - Export data
- `Project Viewer` - Read-only access

#### Custom Roles

Organizations can create custom roles with specific permission sets tailored to their needs. Custom roles are defined at the workspace level and can be granted at both workspace and project levels.

### Granting Roles

Roles are granted through IAM policies at two levels:

1. **Workspace IAM Policy** (Workspace > Members page)
   - Grant roles that apply across all projects
   - Manage workspace-level permissions

2. **Project IAM Policy** (Project > Members page)
   - Grant roles for specific project resources
   - Inherits roles granted at the workspace level

<Tip>
**Inheritance:** Project IAM policies automatically inherit roles granted at the workspace level. For example, if a user is granted `Project Developer` at the workspace level, they have that role in all projects.

## Creating Custom Roles

1. Navigate to **IAM & Admin > Custom Roles**
2. Click **Add role**
3. Configure permissions for your new role

![add-custom-role](/content/docs/administration/roles/add-custom-role.webp)

Use **Import from role** to start with an existing role's permissions and modify them as needed.

<Tip>
**Example:** To create a role that can approve and comment on issues but not execute them, create a `Project Approver` role by importing from `Project Releaser` and removing execution permissions.
</Tip>

## Granting Roles in IAM Policy

Roles (both built-in and custom) can be assigned to users and groups through the Members page at either workspace or project level:

1. Navigate to **Members** page (either in Workspace or specific Project)
2. Click **Grant Access** to add users or groups
3. Select the appropriate roles to grant
4. Confirm to apply the IAM policy changes

When roles are granted at the workspace level, they automatically apply to all projects. Project-level grants only affect the specific project.

## Appendix

### Workspace Role Permissions

By default, the first registered user is granted the `Admin` role, all following registered users are granted `Member` role. `Admin` can update any user's role later.

### Project Role Permissions

Any user can create project. By default, the project creator is granted the `Project Owner` role. `Workspace DBA` and `Workspace Admin` assume the `Project Owner` role for all projects.

| Project Permission           | SQL Editor User | Project Exporter | Project Developer | Project Owner | Workspace DBA | Workspace Admin |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Change project role          |                 |                  |                   | ✔️            | ✔️            | ✔️              |

### Database Permissions

Bytebase does not define database specific roles. Whether a user can perform certain action to the database is based on the user's Workspace role and the role of the project owning the database.

| Database Permission | SQL Editor User | Project Exporter | Project Developer | Project Owner | Workspace DBA | Workspace Admin |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Query               | ✔️              |                  |                   | ✔️            | ✔️            | ✔️              |
| Export              |                 | ✔️               |                   | ✔️            | ✔️            | ✔️              |
| Edit database label |                 |                  |                   | ✔️            | ✔️            | ✔️              |
| Transfer database   |                 |                  |                   | ✔️            | ✔️            | ✔️              |
