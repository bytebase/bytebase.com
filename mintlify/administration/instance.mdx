## Instance connection

Check [Connect Your Database](/get-started/instance/).

## Scan interval

<Tip>

You can always sync the database schema manually.

</Tip>

Bytebase needs to fetch the databases' schema information:

- [SQL review](/sql-review/overview/), [Dynamic Data Masking](/security/data-masking/overview/), and etc all require an up-to-date schema info.
- [SQL Editor](/sql-editor/overview/), [Schema Editor](/change-database/schema-editor/) also require
  schema info.
- [Schema Drift Detection](/change-database/drift-detection/) needs to compare with the schema in the live database.

On the other hand, fetching schemas too frequently will impact the database operations. We allow users to
configure a sync interval.

## Maximum connections

Bytebase may open multiple connections to a particular instance if there are concurrent ongoing database
operations. To avoid overwhelming the instance, you can configure the maximum connections that Bytebase
can open.
