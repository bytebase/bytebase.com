Custom roles allows to group a custom set of permissions and grant them to the users and groups. Custom roles are project roles. Like the built-in project roles:

- Custom roles are defined at the workspace level.
- Custom roles can be granted at both the workspace level (meaning all projects) and the project level.
- Custom roles can be used in [Rollback Policy](/docs/administration/environment-policy/rollout-policy/), [Custom Approval](/docs/administration/custom-approval).
