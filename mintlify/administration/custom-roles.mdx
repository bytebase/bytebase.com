Custom roles allows to group a custom set of permissions and grant them to the users and groups. Like the built-in roles:

- Custom roles are defined at the workspace level.
- Custom roles can be granted at both the workspace level (meaning all projects) and the project level.
- Custom roles can be used in [Rollback Policy](/administration/environment-policy/rollout-policy/), [Custom Approval](/administration/custom-approval).

## Create custom roles

To create custom roles, go to **IAM & Admin > Custom Roles**. Click **Add role** to create a new role.

You can choose `Import from role` to build your custom role based on the existing role.

<Tip>

If you want a role to approve and comment the issue. You can create a `Project Approver` custom role
based on the existing `Project Releaser`.
