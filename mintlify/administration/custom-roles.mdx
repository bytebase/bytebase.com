In addition to built-in roles, you can create custom roles with specific sets of permissions tailored to your organization's needs. Custom roles provide fine-grained access control for users and groups.

**Key characteristics:**
- Defined at the workspace level for consistent management
- Can be granted at both workspace level (applies to all projects) and individual project level
- Integrate with [Rollout Policy](/administration/environment-policy/rollout-policy/) and [Custom Approval](/administration/custom-approval) workflows

## Creating Custom Roles

1. Navigate to **IAM & Admin > Custom Roles**
2. Click **Add role**
3. Configure permissions for your new role

You can use **Import from role** to start with an existing role's permissions and modify them as needed.

<Tip>

**Example:** To create a role that can approve and comment on issues but not execute them, create a `Project Approver` role by importing from `Project Releaser` and removing execution permissions.

</Tip>

## Using Custom Roles in Approval Workflows

1. Navigate to **CI/CD > Custom Approval**
2. Select the **Approval Flows** tab
3. Choose an approval flow and add your custom role

## Granting Custom Roles

To assign a custom role to users or groups:

1. Navigate to the project's **Members** page
2. Grant the custom role to the desired users or groups
3. Users with this role will automatically be included in any configured approval workflows
