## Rate Limiting for Login Attempts

Bytebase implements rate limiting to protect against brute force attacks on user authentication. The system automatically tracks and limits failed login attempts:

### Password Authentication Phase
- **Maximum attempts**: 10 failed attempts
- **Time window**: 10 minutes
- After exceeding the limit, the account will be temporarily locked

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Phase
- **Maximum attempts**: 5 failed attempts
- **Time window**: 5 minutes
- After exceeding the limit, the MFA verification will be temporarily locked
- MFA temporary token expires after 5 minutes

These security measures help protect user accounts from unauthorized access attempts while ensuring legitimate users can still access their accounts.

## Sign-in Frequency

**Sign-in Frequency** specifies the period that users are required to sign in again.

In Bytebase Workspace, Go to **Settings** > **General** and scroll down to **Account** section.

You need to restart Bytebase to make the change take effect.

## Disallow Sign-in with Email & Password

Once [SSO](/administration/sso/overview) is configured, you can [enforce SSO sign-in](/administration/sso/overview/#enforce-sso-sign-in) for all users.

## Sign-in from Email Domains

Go to **Settings** > **General**, scroll down to **Security** section. For **Workspace Domain**, you can configure allowed email domains for your workspace members. Click **Add domain** to add multiple domains as needed. After adding your domains, enable the **Members restriction** checkbox to enforce the restriction.

Following domains are disallowed:

- gmail.com
- googlemail.com
- outlook.com
