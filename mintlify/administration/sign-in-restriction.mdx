## Sign-in Frequency

**Sign-in Frequency** specifies the period that users are required to sign in again.

In Bytebase Workspace, Go to **Settings** > **General** and scroll down to **Account** section.

You need to restart Bytebase to make the change take effect.

## Disallow Sign-in with Email & Password

<PricingPlanBlock feature_name="DISALLOW_SIGNIN_WITH_EMAIL_PASSWORD" />

Once [SSO](/administration/sso/overview) is configured, you can [enforce SSO sign-in](/administration/sso/overview/#enforce-sso-sign-in) for all users.

## Sign-in from Email Domains

Go to **Settings** > **General**, scroll down to **Security** section. For **Workspace Domain**, you can configure allowed email domains for your workspace members. Click **Add domain** to add multiple domains as needed. After adding your domains, enable the **Members restriction** checkbox to enforce the restriction.

Domain restriction applies to:

- Sign-in page. (Note that the new restriction only applies to the accounts registered after the **Workspace Domain** was updated)

- **Add User** in **IAM & Admin** > **Users & Groups**. Users' email must be of the domain you set.
