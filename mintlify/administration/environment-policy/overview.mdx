## Statement execution mode

Even if you have `sql.dml` and `sql.ddl` [database permissions](/docs/security/database-permission/overview/), you can only run read-only statements such as `SELECT` in SQL Editor by default. If you attempt to run mutation DML or DDL, it will prompt you to submit an issue.

If you want to run those statements directly in SQL Editor, you need to turn on the **statement execution** setting.

## Environment tier

### Environment color

You can configure any color for an environment either by inputting in **HEX** tab or choosing one in the palette.

![env-color](/content/docs/administration/environment-policy/env-color.webp)

SQL Editor then displays the configured color tab.

### Production indicator

Once you mark an environment as a production environment, Bytebase will attach a shield icon üõ°Ô∏è besides the environment name.
