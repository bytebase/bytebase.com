title: User Groups
feature_name: USER_GROUPS
---

`User Group` or simply `Group` contains a set of users. `Group` simplifies access management as you can grant
roles to a `Group` instead of granting to the individual users one by one.

## Constraints

- Bytebase does not support nested group. A group can only contain users, it can't contain another group.
- You can only add normal user account to the group and can not add service account. Service account within a group is an [anti-pattern](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/best-practices-service-accounts#groups).

## Add group

Within Workspace, go to **IAM & Admin** > **Users & Groups**, and **Add Group** from top-right.

![add-group](/content/docs/administration/user-groups/add-group.webp)

Create an Email for this group, it'll serve as an account and _cannot be changed after creation_. Fill the group's name into the Title bar. You can **Add member** below, where they can be `Group member` as well as `Group owner`.

![add-group-detail](/content/docs/administration/user-groups/add-group-detail.webp)

Here we've created a `Contractor Group`, you can view or edit it under **Groups** page.

![view-under-groups](/content/docs/administration/user-groups/view-under-groups.webp)

You can see which group a user belongs to under **Users** page as well.

## Grant roles to group

Now that we've created this `Contractor Group`, we can assign corresponding permissions to these groups within any project.

**Select Project** from top left. Enter `Basic Project`.

![enter-basic-project](/content/docs/administration/user-groups/enter-basic-project.webp)

Go to **Manage** > **Members** where you can see the project's members and roles. Our `Contractor Group` is not among them before we **Grant Access** to the group from top right.

Choose **Groups** and Select our group in **Grant Access** detail page. **Assign role** and **Confirm**.

![grant-access](/content/docs/administration/user-groups/grant-access.webp)

Now you can see the `Contractor Group` under **View by members** page as well as **View by roles** page within **Members** section of `Basic Project`.

![project-members-or-roles](/content/docs/administration/user-groups/project-members-or-roles.webp)

All members within this group now share permission to the project.

## Service account

You can only add normal user account to the group and can not add service account.

Service accounts are designed for application use, with each application typically having unique access needs. Since applications rarely perform identical functions, their required resource access tends to differ, making shared or identical permissions uncommon.
