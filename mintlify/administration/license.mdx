## Configure instance license

The license includes a number of database instance quota.

- For Pro plan, you need to purchase a Pro license with a minimum 1 instance quota.
- For Enterprise plan, you need to purchase an Enterprise license with a minimum 5 instance quota.

Features like [SSO](/docs/administration/sso/overview/), [Watermark](/docs/security/watermark/) are Enterprise features and not specific to a particular instance. Thus as long as you have the Enterprise license, you can use those features.

On the other hand, there are instance specific features like [custom approval](/docs/administration/custom-approval), [sensitive data masking](/docs/security/data-masking/overview). To activate those features on the instance, you need to assign the quota to the instance.

The price is based on the Plan and the purchased instance quota. To save budget, you can just purchase the instance quota covering a subset of your instances (e.g. only production instances).
