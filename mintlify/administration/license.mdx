## Configure instance license

The license includes a number of database instance quota.

- For Pro plan, you need to purchase a Pro license with a minimum 1 instance quota.
- For Enterprise plan, you need to purchase an Enterprise license with a minimum 5 instance quota.

Features like [SSO](/administration/sso/overview/), [Watermark](/security/watermark/) are Enterprise features and not specific to a particular instance. Thus as long as you have the Enterprise license, you can use those features.

On the other hand, there are instance specific features like [custom approval](/administration/custom-approval), [sensitive data masking](/security/data-masking/overview). To activate those features on the instance, you need to assign the quota to the instance.

<Tip>

The price is based on the Plan and the purchased instance quota. To save budget, you can just purchase the instance quota covering a subset of your instances (e.g. only production instances).
