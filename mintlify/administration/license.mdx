## License Overview

Bytebase offers [3 pricing plans](https://www.bytebase.com/pricing): `Free`, `Pro`, `Enterprise`. Both `Pro` and `Enterprise` plans require purchasing license. You can [contact us](https://www.bytebase.com/contact-us/) to request a 2-week free trial.

## What a License Covers

A license includes an **instance quota**, which defines:

- The number of **active database instances** (with assigned instance-level licenses)

- The **total number of instances** allowed under the plan

### Plan Details

- Under the **Pro** plan, purchasing **1 to 20 user seats** includes **10 active database instances at no additional cost**.

- Under the **Enterprise** plan, you must purchase a license with a minimum quota of **5 active instances**.

### Feature Availability

- **Enterprise-wide features**, such as [SSO](/administration/sso/overview/) and [Watermark](/security/watermark/) are **not instace-specific** and are available as long as you hold an Enterprise license.

- **Instance-specific features**, including [Custom Approval](/administration/custom-approval) and [Sensitive Data Masking](/security/data-masking/overview), **require assigning quota** to individual instances to be activated.
  For full details, see our [pricing page](https://www.bytebase.com/pricing/).

<Tip>

To reduce costs, you can license only a subset of your instances (e.g., production instances only).
