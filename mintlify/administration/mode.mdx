Bytebase supports 2 database change mode:

- **Issue mode**. Use issue to request, review, roll out, and version database changes.
- **SQL Editor Mode**. Use SQL Editor to operate database directly. You may also choose this mode if you want to [embed SQL Editor into your
  own app](/docs/tutorials/embed-sql-editor/).

## Configuration

The first registered user will be prompted to choose the database change mode. Afterwards, the **Workspace Admin** can change it under **Setting** > **General**.
