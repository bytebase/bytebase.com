title: Organize Projects
---

Bytebase has a `Project` concept to group logically related `Databases`, `Issues`, and `Users` together. This is similar to the project concept in other tools such as Jira or GitLab.

There are several ways to organize projects:

* **Organize by team boundary** — Since `Project` is a logical concept, a natural approach is to organize by team boundary.
* **Organize by application** — If a team manages multiple applications, or an application is co-owned by multiple teams, you can organize by application. A typical scenario is when there is a shared component used by multiple teams.
* **Organize by database schema** — If you have a multi-tenant SaaS application, you can group all tenant databases into the same project, allowing you to manage changes together.
* **Organize by environment** — Although Bytebase already has an `Environment` concept, you can further fine-tune settings by creating environment-specific projects.

For large organizations, it’s not uncommon to combine multiple approaches. For example, you might first organize projects by application, and then further organize them by environment.

<Tip>

To manage project roles at scale, you can create a [user group](/administration/user-groups/) for the team and grant the project role to that group. You can also integrate a [directory service](/administration/scim/overview) to sync group membership with Bytebase.
