title: Organize Projects
---

Bytebase has a `Project` concept to group logically related `Databases`, `Issues` and `Users` together. This
is similar to the project concept in other tools such as Jira, GitLab.

We recommend you to put databases sharing the same schema structure into the same project. For example,
if you have a multi-tenant SaaS application, you can put all the tenant databases into the same project.

If you have a single team managing databases with different schema structure, you can create a project for each
schema structure, and create a [user group](/administration/user-groups/) for the team. You then grant the project role to the user group.
