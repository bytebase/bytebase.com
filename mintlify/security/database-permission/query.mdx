Bytebase users query data from [SQL Editor](/sql-editor/run-queries/). Bytebase can enforce query access control for a particular user at the database, schema or table level.

## Assign SQL Editor User Role

`Workspace Admin`, `Workspace DBA` or `Project Owner` can manually grant `SQL Editor User` role to users/groups.

### Assign at Project level

**Select Project** and go to **Manage > Members**. Then **Grant Access**.

You can choose the entire database, a particular schema, or a particular table.

### Assign at Workspace level

`Workspace Admin` can assign `SQL Editor User` role at the workspace level. This will grant query permission to _all databases_ within _all projects_.

From the workspace page, go to **IAM & Admin > Members**, **Grant Access** to Select users/groups and assign `SQL Editor User` to them.
