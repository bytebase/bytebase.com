title: Request a Role

## Via Project

Within a project, if you at least have a **Project Viewer** role (or other roles that can access the project), you can request other roles.

1. Go to **Database > Databases** or **Manage > Members** on the left sidebar. You can see the **Request role** button on the top.

   ![bb-project-members](/content/docs/security/database-permission/request/bb-project-members.webp)

1. Click **Request role** button, you can see the available roles. Here we request a **SQL Editor** role (which allow the user to access the SQL Editor). You may manually select database and tables.

1. After submitting the request, there's an request issue created matched with the [custom approval](/docs/administration/custom-approval/) you configured. Once the request is approved, the user will have the requested role.

## Via SQL Editor

For **SQL Editor User** role, you can also request it via SQL Editor.
