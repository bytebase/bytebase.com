title: One-Time Export
---

Except for requesting or being assigned `Project Exporter` role to export data repeatedly, you can also request a one-time export in **Export Center**.

## One-time Export Request

Approval flow matches the `Export Data` in [custom approval](/change-database/approval/) if configured.

### Request from SQL Editor

Data can be exported directly from the SQL Editor result panel if you have the export permission for the data.

Without the export permission, you can request a one-time export via **Request Export**.

![sql-editor-request-export](/content/docs/security/database-permission/export/sql-editor-request-export.webp)

You will be redirected to an issue page. **Create** the issue. After approval, you'll be able to export the data one time.

### Request from Export Center

Enter **Export Center** within a project, where you **Request Export**, select a database and click **Next**.

![export-center](/content/docs/security/database-permission/export/export-center.webp)

You'll be creating an issue. Enable **Encrypt** and set **Password** if needed, fill your query commands in **SQL** block. **Create** the issue.

![export-preview](/content/docs/security/database-permission/export/export-preview.webp)

After approval, you can click **Export** to download the exported file _once_.

![export](/content/docs/security/database-permission/export/export.webp)

The exported issue will be displayed in **Export Center**.
