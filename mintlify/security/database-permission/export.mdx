Bytebase users obtain `Project Exporter` role to export data repeatedly or request a one-time export in **Export Center**.

## Assign Project Exporter Role

`Workspace Admin`, `Workspace DBA` or `Project Owner` can manually grant `Project Exporter` role to users/groups.

### Assign at Project level

**Select Project** and go to **Manage > Members**. Then **Grant Access**.

Select Users or Groups, assign `Project Exporter` role. You can manually select databases/schemas/tables, alter `Max export rows`, and `Expiration`. Then click **Confirm**.

### Assign at Workspace level

`Workspace Admin` can assign `Project Exporter` role at the workspace level. This will grant export permission to _all databases_ within _all projects_.

From the workspace page, go to **IAM & Admin > Members**, **Grant Access** to select users/groups and assign `Project Exporter`.
