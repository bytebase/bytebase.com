title: Export Data

There are two ways to export data:

- As **SQL Editor User**, you can export directly from SQL Editor.
- As **Project Developer**, you can request a one-time export in **Export Center**.

## Export directly from SQL Editor

As **SQL Editor User**, after you run a query, you can export the result by clicking **Export** button. The exported data still respects the masking policy to mask exported columns.

## One-time Export Request

As **Project Developer**, you can request a one-time export in **Export Center**. Approval flow matches the `Export Data` in [custom approval](/change-database/approval/) if configured.

Enter **Export Center** within a project, where you **Request Export**, select a database and click **Next**.

You'll be creating an issue. Enable **Encrypt** and set **Password** if needed, fill your query commands in **SQL** block. **Create** the issue.
