Bytebase is a middleware sitting between users and databases. It provides a fine-grained database permissions. Bytebase enforces
database permissions via [change approval flow](/change-database/change-workflow/) and [SQL Editor](/sql-editor/overview/).
You can use Bytebase to manage persistent database permissions as well as implement Just-in-Time (JIT) database access workflow.

Database permission controls individual users' or groups' actions within the database. Below shows the built-in roles' database permissions.

  | Role              | EXPLAIN | Query | Export | Mutation DML | DDL | Admin |
  | ----------------- | ------- | ----- | ------ | ------------ | --- | ----- |
  | Workspace Admin   | ✅      | ✅    | ✅     | ✅           | ✅  | ✅    |
  | Workspace DBA     | ✅      | ✅    | ✅     | ✅           | ✅  | ✅    |
  | Project Owner     | ✅      | ✅    | ✅     | ✅           | ✅  |       |
  | Project Developer |         |       | \*1       |  \*2        | \*2  |       |
  | SQL Editor User   | ✅      | ✅    | ✅        |  \*3          | \*3  |       |
  | Project Releaser  |         |       |        |              |     |       |
  | Project Viewer    |         |       |        |              |     |       |

\*1 _**Project Developer** can create Export issues for one-time exports. While **SQL Editor User** can export directly from SQL Editor._

\*2 _**Project Developer** don’t have SQL Editor access and should request DDL/DML changes through an issue._

\*3 _**SQL Editor User** can run DDL/DML in SQL Editor unless restricted by [environment policy](/change-database/environment-policy/overview#statement-execution-mode), but it’s recommended to make these changes through issues for better traceability._

You can also pick out specific permissions to build [custom roles](/administration/roles). e.g. create a custom role that grants only the `EXPLAIN` permission.
