## Workspace

A `Workspace` represents your entire Bytebase installation and contains all users, projects, databases, and resources. Each Bytebase deployment is one workspace, making this concept largely transparent to users. For workspace separation, deploy multiple installations.

## Project

A `Project` organizes related databases, users, and issues for team collaboration. Like projects in Jira or GitLab, it's the main organizational unit where all work happens. Developers primarily work within projects.

## Database Instance

A `Database Instance` represents a database server or cluster that you connect to via host and port. Examples include your MySQL server, PostgreSQL cluster, or AWS RDS instance. Instances can host multiple databases. Workspace admins and DBAs primarily manage database instances.

## Database

A `Database` is an individual database within a database instance. Each database belongs to a single project. Project developers primarily work with databases.

## User

A `User` represents anyone who can access and perform operations in Bytebase. Users include both human team members and service accounts.

## User Group

A `User Group` organizes multiple users together for easier permission management. Workspace admins create groups and add users, then assign these groups to roles within projects. For security reasons, service accounts cannot be part of user groups.

## Role

See [Roles and Permissions](/concepts/roles-and-permissions).

## Database Group

A `Database Group` contains multiple databases with similar schema structures, such as per-tenant or partitioned databases. Bytebase can apply [batch changes](/change-database/batch-change) consistently across all databases in a group.

## Environment

An `Environment` represents a stage in your development pipeline, such as test, staging, or production. Environments typically map one-to-one with your actual deployment environments. Workspace admins can attach organizational policies to environments.

## CI/CD

See [CI/CD Core Concepts](/change-database/change-workflow/#core-concepts).
