![Bytebase data model](/content/docs/core-concepts/data-model-v2.webp)

## Workspace

The entire Bytebase workspace runs as a single unit. Most of the time, the `Workspace` concept is transparent to the user because there is only one workspace per Bytebase deployment or installation. We mention this here because it's a common concept among SaaS products. Bytebase does NOT plan to support multiple workspaces in the foreseeable future. However, you can run multiple Bytebase deployments to achieve a similar result.

## User

A user in the Bytebase workspace is defined as a member. `member` models after a subject performing the operation. Most of the time, user corresponds to a human being. Bytebase also has a special robot user named "Bytebase" (ID=1) which conducts automatic operations.

Internally, Bytebase uses term `Principal` instead of `User` because former is more accurate to describe both human user and robot user.

## User Group

`User group`or `Group` is a collection of `Users` that are organized together to simplify the management of roles and permissions.

`Admins` can create user groups and assign `Users` to them at the `Workspace` level. `Admins`,`DBAs` and `Project Owners` can then assign these `User Groups` to `Roles` at the `Project` level.

## Role

See [Roles and Permissions](/concepts/roles-and-permissions).

## Environment

`Environment` models after various environments in the development pipeline such as test, staging, prod. Most of the time, there is a 1:1 mapping between `Environment` and the real environment.

Most of the time, `Admins` and `DBAs` work with the `Environment`.

## Database Instance

<Note>

Bytebase is charged based on the **number of database instances**. If you have 1 instance containing hundreds of
databases, it will be counted as 1. The below graph has 2 database instances, 1 for MySQL and 1 for PostgreSQL. Each instance contains 3 databases. You can manage all instances in Bytebase while purchase [a subset of instance licenses](/administration/license/).

</Note>

![Database Instance](/content/docs/core-concepts/db-instance-and-db.webp)

`Database Instance` or simply `Instance` models after a single database server accessed via a host:port address or a primary/replica cluster. A typical database instance could be your on-premises MySQL instance, a PostgreSQL cluster, an AWS RDS instance etc. Each `Database Instance` belongs to an `Environment`. A `Database Instance` can contain multiple `Databases`.

Most of the time, `Admins` and `DBAs` work with the `Database Instance`.

## Database

`Database` refers to a single database from a Database Instance. A database is the one created by 'CREATE DATABASE xxx'. A database always belongs to a single `Project`.

Most of the time, `Developers` and `DBAs` work with the `Database`.

## Database Group

A list of databases usually having the same schema structure. Examples like per-tenant databases, and partitioned databases. Bytebase can [batch change](/change-database/batch-change) `Database Group` consistently.

## Project

<Tip>

[How to organize projects?](/onboarding/organize-projects)

</Tip>

`Project` is a logic unit to model a team effort. It's similar to the project concept in other dev tools such as Jira, GitLab. `Project` is the container to group logically related `Databases`, `Issues` and `Users` together. In Bytebase, A `Database` or an `Issue` always belongs to a single `Project`. `Project` is also the peering entity with the VCS repository to setup [GitOps workflow](/vcs-integration/overview).

Most of the time, `Developers` work with the `Project`.

## Sheet

`Sheet` is the entity where users store, run and share the SQL scripts. A paritcular sheet belongs
to a project and may or may not attach a database context. Users interacts with the Sheet from
[SQL Editor](/sql-editor/manage-sql-scripts).
