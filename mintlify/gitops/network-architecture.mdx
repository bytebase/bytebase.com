title: Network Architecture and External Access
---

This guide explains the network connectivity options for Bytebase features that require external access, including GitOps workflows, SSO authentication, and webhooks.

## Features Requiring External Access

- **GitOps Workflows**: CI/CD platforms (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.) need to call Bytebase API
- **SSO Authentication**: OAuth2/OIDC/SAML providers need callback access
- **Webhooks**: External services sending events to Bytebase

## Three Network Patterns

### 1. Bytebase Cloud
Use [Bytebase Cloud](https://hub.bytebase.com/) for instant setup without infrastructure management. External services connect directly.

**Best for:** Quick testing, evaluation, and small teams

### 2. Self-Hosted Production with Private Runners

Deploy Bytebase in your private network with self-hosted CI/CD runners. No internet exposure.

**Best for:** Production environments with security requirements

**Runner Documentation:**
- [GitHub Actions self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners)
- [GitLab runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/)
- [Bitbucket runners](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/runners/)
- [Azure DevOps agents](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/agents)

### 3. Self-Hosted Local Testing with Reverse Proxy

Temporarily expose local Bytebase for testing using reverse proxy tools such as:
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
- [VS Code port forwarding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/port-forwarding)
- Other tunneling services

<Warning>
Never use reverse proxy tools in production. They are for local testing only.
</Warning>

<Info>
**Important for Self-Hosted:** Remember to configure the External URL in Bytebase **Settings > General** with your public URL for SSO callbacks and other integrations to work properly.
