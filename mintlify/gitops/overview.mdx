Bytebase offers a database-as-code workflow, enabling you to manage database changes directly through your version control system (VCS).

Bytebase provides pre-built actions for popular CI/CD platforms. For custom requirements, you can build your own pipeline using the [Bytebase API](/integrations/api/overview).

## Capabilities

Bytebase GitOps integration provides two core capabilities:

### Versioned Database Migrations

- **Database-as-code workflow** - Manage database changes through your VCS just like application code
- **Schema and data changes** - Support for both DDL (CREATE/ALTER/DROP tables, indexes) and DML (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) operations
- **Change detection** - Automatically detects and skips already applied migrations, ensuring idempotency
- **Progressive deployments** - Automated rollout across environments (test → staging → production)
- **Multi-database support** - Apply changes across multiple databases with batch operations


## GitOps Workflow

### 1. Development Phase

Developers create SQL migration files in their feature branches:

- Schema changes (DDL): `202501150900_add_user_table.sql`
- Data changes (DML): `202501150901_seed_initial_data_dml.sql`

<Note>Filenames must conform to the [versioning format](#requirements).</Note>

### 2. Review Phase (Pull Request)

- SQL review runs automatically on the PR
- Validates changes against configured policies
- No release created yet - only validation

### 3. Release Creation (Merge)

When the PR is merged to main:

- GitOps integration automatically creates a new release
- All SQL files from the merge are packaged together
- Release is assigned a unique identifier
- Linked to the merge commit for traceability

### 4. Progressive Deployment

The release follows your configured deployment pipeline:

- **Test Environment**: Automatic deployment after creation
- **Staging Environment**: May require manual approval
- **Production Environment**: Typically requires explicit approval
- Each deployment is tracked with timing and status

**Important**: When deploying a release, Bytebase automatically detects which migrations have already been applied to the target database and skips them. This ensures safe re-deployment and allows the same release to be deployed multiple times without errors.
