---

This guide covers the setup requirements for connecting Version Control Systems (VCS) with Bytebase.

## Bytebase Cloud

**No installation required** for cloud VCS providers:
- GitHub.com
- GitLab.com  
- Bitbucket Cloud
- Azure DevOps Services

These services connect directly to Bytebase Cloud.

### Self-Hosted GitLab

- Install a [GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/) on your GitLab server
- Ensure your VPC firewall rules allow connections between Self-Hosted GitLab and Bytebase Cloud

## Bytebase Self-Host

Self-hosted Bytebase requires specific setup based on your VCS provider.

### Cloud VCS Providers

When using cloud VCS with self-hosted Bytebase, you need a self-hosted runner:

**GitHub.com**
- Install a [GitHub self-hosted runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners)
- Ensure runner can access your Bytebase instance

**GitLab.com**  
- Install a [GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/)
- Register runner with your GitLab.com project

**Bitbucket Cloud**
- Install a [Bitbucket self-hosted runner](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/runners/)
- Configure Bitbucket Pipelines to use the runner

**Azure DevOps Services**
- Install a [Self-hosted Azure Pipelines Agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/agents)
- Register agent with your Azure DevOps organization

### Self-Hosted GitLab

No runner installation needed. Simply ensure:
- VPC connectivity between GitLab and Bytebase servers
- Network policies allow communication
- If your GitLab runner lacks internet access, pre-load the bytebase-action Docker image
