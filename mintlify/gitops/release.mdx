title: Release

Bytebase integrates with popular CI/CD platforms to automate database releases through GitOps workflows.

## Release Workflow

When triggered by your CI/CD pipeline, Bytebase automatically creates a **release** - an immutable package containing all your SQL migration files. This release can then be progressively deployed across your database environments (test → staging → production), ensuring consistent and traceable database changes.

<Note>

To reach your self-hosted Bytebase from GitHub Actions, you can choose either options:

1. Tunnel GitHub Actions using [Cloudflare Zero Trust](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) with [Cloudflare Warp GitHub Actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-cloudflare-warp).

1. Use [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners).

</Note>

Bytebase provides pre-built [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/marketplace?query=bytebase&type=actions) to ease the GitHub integration.

<Note>

If you're using **self-hosted GitLab** in an internal network:

1. You'll need to [manually load the `bytebase/bytebase-action` image](/tutorials/gitops-gitlab-workflow#use-bytebase-action-in-an-offline-gitlab-runner) into your internal Docker registry.

1. Set the [`clone_url` in GitLab Runner](/tutorials/gitops-gitlab-workflow#resolve-gitlab-clone-redirect-in-internal-network) to avoid redirection to external addresses.
