title: SQL Review
---

SQL Review automatically validates your database changes against configured policies before they're executed. This ensures consistency and catches potential issues early in the change process.

## How It Works in UI-Driven Workflow

When developers create a Plan, SQL Review automatically validates the statements and flags any violations before human review:

The review process runs immediately when you:
- Create a new Plan with SQL changes
- Edit SQL statements in an existing Plan
- Import schema changes from another source

## Review Results

SQL Review results appear directly in the Plan interface, showing:
- **Errors**: Must be fixed before the change can proceed
- **Warnings**: Should be reviewed but won't block execution
- **Passed checks**: Confirmations that rules are satisfied

## Configuring Review Policies

Review policies determine which rules are enforced for your database changes. You can configure these policies at the environment or project level.

## Handling Review Feedback

When SQL Review identifies issues:

1. **Review the findings**: Click on each issue to understand what needs to be fixed
2. **Update your SQL**: Modify the statements to comply with the rules
3. **Re-run the review**: The review automatically runs again when you save changes
4. **Proceed when cleared**: Once all errors are resolved, continue with the approval process

## Integration with Approval Flow

SQL Review acts as the first gate in your change management process:
- Review must pass before human approvers are notified
- Failed reviews can be configured to block automatic rollout
- Review results are included in approval notifications

This automated validation reduces the burden on reviewers and ensures consistent quality standards across all database changes.
