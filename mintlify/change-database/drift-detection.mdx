title: Schema Drift Detection
feature_name: 'DRIFT_DETECTION'
---

Bytebase is supposed to take over applying the database schema changes on behalf of the user. It records the detailed migration history and the before/after schema snapshot for each migration it applies.

Drift usually happens when user applies out-of-band schema changes (such as hot fix) directly to the database without using Bytebase.

## Simulate

You can simulate schema drift by using **Admin mode** within Bytebase SQL Editor. It's similar to operating within your terminal.

Visit SQL Editor, connect a database and click the gold wrench icon to enter Admin mode.

You can make some Schema change here. Then Exit.

## Detect

Bytebase has a background process to periodically compare the recorded latest schema with the actual schema in the live database and surface the drift if found. The check interval is configured in [Scan Interval](/get-started/connect/overview#sync-interval).

You can also click **Sync Database** manually from the database detail page to check drift immediately.

Schema Drift is detected and displayed under **Anomalies** section.

Click **View diff** to see the drift details.

## Remediate

There are 2 options to remediate the schema drift:

- **Baseline**: Use the live database schema as the source of truth. And establish a new baseline for
  the Bytebase schema state.
- **Revert**: Use the Bytebase schema state as the source of truth. And revert the live database schema.

### Baseline

Within `Sample Project`, go to **Database** > **Databases**. Click and enter detail page of database `hr_prod`, go to **Change History** page.

**Establish new baseline** from top right, you'll be redirected to an issue page. **Create** this issue on top right and it rolls out automatically. The newly created baseline appears in **Change History**.

### Revert

Check the schema drift detail, figure out the rollback SQL statements, and create a Bytebase issue to rollback.
