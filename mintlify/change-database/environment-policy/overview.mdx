title: Environment Policy
---

Configure and manage your database environments including policies, permissions, and lifecycle operations.

## Environment tier

### Environment color

You can configure any color for an environment either by inputting in **HEX** tab or choosing one in the palette.

![env-color](/content/docs/administration/environment-policy/env-color.webp)

SQL Editor then displays the configured color tab.

![env-color-sql-editor](/content/docs/administration/environment-policy/env-color-sql-editor.webp)

### Production indicator

Once you mark an environment as a production environment, Bytebase will attach a shield icon üõ°Ô∏è besides the environment name.

![tier-envs](/content/docs/administration/environment-policy/tier-envs.webp)

## Rollout policy

Control who can deploy changes to each environment and whether deployments happen automatically or require manual approval.

## SQL Review policy

Configure automated SQL validation rules for each environment to ensure code quality and compliance. Different environments can have different strictness levels - for example, production might enforce stricter rules than development.

## Access control

Configure environment-specific restrictions for SQL Editor operations:

- **Restrict data copying in SQL Editor**: Only Workspace Admins and DBAs can copy data from query results
- **Restrict querying admin data sources**: Limit access to administrative data sources in the SQL Editor

## Statement execution mode

Even if you have `sql.dml` and `sql.ddl` [database permissions](/security/database-permission/overview/), you can only run read-only statements such as `SELECT` in SQL Editor by default. If you attempt to run mutation DML or DDL, it will prompt you to submit an issue.

![prompt-issue](/content/docs/administration/environment-policy/prompt-issue.webp)

If you want to run those statements directly in SQL Editor, you need to turn on the **statement execution** setting.

## Delete an environment

To permanently delete an environment:

1. Navigate to the environment page
2. Click **Delete this environment** at the bottom of the page
3. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
Deleting an environment will also remove it from all related instances and databases. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>
