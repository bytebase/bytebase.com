title: Environment Policy
---

Configure and manage your database environments including policies, permissions, and lifecycle operations.

## Environment tier

### Environment color

You can configure any color for an environment either by inputting in **HEX** tab or choosing one in the palette.

SQL Editor then displays the configured color tab.

### Production indicator

Once you mark an environment as a production environment, Bytebase will attach a shield icon üõ°Ô∏è besides the environment name.

## Rollout policy

Control who can deploy changes to each environment and whether deployments happen automatically or require manual approval.

## SQL Review policy

Configure automated SQL validation rules for each environment to ensure code quality and compliance. Different environments can have different strictness levels - for example, production might enforce stricter rules than development.

## Access control

Configure environment-specific restrictions for SQL Editor operations:

- **Restrict data copying in SQL Editor**: Only Workspace Admins and DBAs can copy data from query results
- **Restrict querying admin data sources**: Limit access to administrative data sources in the SQL Editor

## Statement execution

By default, users with **SQL Editor User** role or `sql.dml` and `sql.ddl` [database permissions](/security/database-permission/overview/) can execute DDL and DML statements directly in SQL Editor. To restrict statement execution to SELECT-only queries and require users to create issues for data modifications, configure the following **statement execution** settings:

- Disallow running DDL statements in the SQL editor
- Disallow running data-modifying DML statements in the SQL Editor

To permanently delete an environment:

1. Navigate to the environment page

Deleting an environment will also remove it from all related instances and databases. This action cannot be undone.
