Configure who can deploy database changes in your environment through rollout permissions. You can choose between role-based deployment by authorized users or automatic deployment when all checks pass.

## Role-based rollout

### Default roles with permissions

Users with the `bb.taskRuns.create` permission can perform rollouts. The following roles have this permission by default:
- Workspace Admin
- Workspace DBA 
- Project Releaser

### Environment-specific roles

If you want to use different roles to perform rollouts in different environments, you can specify environment-specific roles in the Environment policy settings. This allows you to control who can deploy changes to specific environments, such as having different teams responsible for staging versus production deployments.


## Automatic rollout

Enable automatic deployment when all checks pass by selecting the `automatic` option. Failed checks will block automatic rollout:

- [SQL Review policy](/sql-review/review-policy) violations

<Note>
Do not enable automatic rollout for GitOps Workflow as it can cause conflicts that result in failures.
