Configure who can deploy database changes and what conditions must be met before rollout can proceed in each environment.

## Role-based rollout

### Default roles with permissions

Users with the `bb.taskRuns.create` permission can perform rollouts. The following roles have this permission by default:

- Workspace Admin
- Workspace DBA
- Project Releaser

### Environment-specific roles

If you want to use different roles to perform rollouts in different environments, you can specify environment-specific roles in the Environment policy settings. This allows you to control who can deploy changes to specific environments, such as having different teams responsible for staging versus production deployments.

## Configurable Rollout Requirements

Configure what conditions must be met before changes can be rolled out in each environment:

### Require Issue Approval

Ensures all changes are reviewed and approved before deployment to production environments. When enabled, issues must receive approval before rollout can proceed.

**Default**: Enabled

### Plan Check Enforcement

Controls how rollout behaves based on plan check results, including SQL Review policy violations and other validations:

- **Block on errors only** (default): Rollout is blocked if checks return errors, but warnings still allow rollout
- **Block on errors and warnings**: Rollout is blocked if checks return either errors or warnings
- **Allow rollout regardless**: Rollout can proceed even if checks return errors or warnings

**Default**: Block on errors only

<Note>
Plan checks include [SQL Review policy](/sql-review/review-policy) violations and other automated validations configured for your environment.
</Note>

## Automatic Rollout

Enable automatic deployment when all checks pass by selecting the `automatic` option. This will automatically deploy changes when:

- All required approvals are obtained (if "Require Issue Approval" is enabled)
- Plan checks pass according to the configured enforcement level

<Note>
Do not enable automatic rollout for GitOps Workflow as it can cause conflicts that result in failures.
