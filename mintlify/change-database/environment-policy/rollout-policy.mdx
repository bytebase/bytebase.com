<Note>

While you **can not** [self-approve](/administration/custom-approval/) your own created issue, once
the issue is approved by the others, you **can** deploy your own issue if qualified.

</Note>

`Workspace Admin` or `DBA` can configure the **Rollout policy** for a particular environment from the **Environment** detail page:

![environment-rollout](/content/docs/administration/environment-policy/bb-env-rollout.webp)

This setting will affect projects using either [UI workflow or GitOps workflow](/change-database/change-workflow). The rollout policy determines who will rollout the database changes.

## Automatic rollout

If `automatic` option is checked, Bytebase will deploy the change automatically if all check have passed. Unpassed checks will block the automatic rollout and require manual intervention:

- [Rollout time](/change-database/change-workflow/#rollout-time)
- [SQL Review violations](/sql-review/overview)

## Manual rollout by dedicated roles

If any roles are specified, Bytebase requires users with those roles to manually deploy the change.

## Manual rollout with custom approval flow

Bytebase requires the last approver from the activated [custom approval flow](/administration/custom-approval/) to deploy the change manually.
