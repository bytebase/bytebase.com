Configure who can deploy database changes in your environment through rollout permissions. You can choose between manual deployment by authorized users or automatic deployment when all checks pass.

## Manual rollout permissions

### Default permissions

Users with the `bb.taskRuns.create` permission can perform rollouts. Built-in roles with this permission:
- Workspace Admin
- Workspace DBA 
- Project Releaser

### Additional permission options

Grant rollout permissions through:

**Environment-specific roles**: Add custom roles per environment in Environment policy settings to control rollouts for specific databases.

**UI workflow permissions**: For UI-driven changes, also grant permissions to:
- Issue Creator
- Last Issue Approver (when using [custom approval flow](/change-database/approval/))

## Automatic rollout

Enable automatic deployment when all checks pass by selecting the `automatic` option. Failed checks will block automatic rollout:

- [SQL Review policy](/sql-review/review-policy) violations

<Note>
Do not enable automatic rollout for GitOps Workflow as it can cause conflicts that result in failures.
