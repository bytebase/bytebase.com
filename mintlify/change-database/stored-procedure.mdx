You can also use Bytebase to change stored procedures by supplying the raw SQL. Same apply for triggers.

1. Go to a project, select a target database, then `Edit Schema`.
   ![edit-schema](/content/docs/change-database/stored-procedure/edit-schema.webp)

1. In the popup, switch to `Raw SQL` and supply the SQL statement. The example below adds
   a stored procedure to reverse the string.
   ![input-raw-sql](/content/docs/change-database/stored-procedure/input-raw-sql.webp)

1. Create the rollout issue.
   ![create-issue](/content/docs/change-database/stored-procedure/create-issue.webp)

1. Review and rollout the issue.
   ![apply-change](/content/docs/change-database/stored-procedure/apply-change.webp)

1. Check the change history that records the change statement and the schema diff.
   ![view-history](/content/docs/change-database/stored-procedure/view-history.webp)
