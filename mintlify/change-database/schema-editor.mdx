**Schema Editor** provides a spreadsheet-like editor to view and edit database structure. Users first use the **Schema Editor** to prepare the schema changes, then those changes will be converted into SQL statements and go through the [change workflow](/change-database/change-workflow).

**Schema Editor** also supports the use of templates for fields and tables. Templates can be pre-defined at the workspace level and can be used to save time and ensure consistency when creating new schema entities. See [Schema Template](/administration/schema-template) for more details.

## Schema Editor Entry

While creating a new plan within a project, go to **CI/CD** > **Plans** in the left menu, and click **New Plan**. Choose `Schema Migration` as the plan type and click **Next**. Select **one** database and click **Next**. You will see the Schema Editor.
