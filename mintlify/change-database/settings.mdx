## Postgres Tenant Mode

Perfect for multi-tenant PostgreSQL setups where each database has its own owner.

When enabled, Bytebase automatically switches to the database's OWNER role before executing changes, ensuring proper permissions.

**Location:** Project → Settings → Issue Related

## Self Approval

By default, issue creators can't approve their own changes.

To allow self-approval, enable **Allow self approval** in your project settings.
