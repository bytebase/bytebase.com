Customize how database changes work in your projects. Navigate to **Project** → **Settings** to access these options.

## Transaction Mode

<Note>
Supported databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, TiDB, Redshift
</Note>

By default, Bytebase wraps SQL statements in a transaction for safety - if something goes wrong, changes can be rolled back.

Some DDL statements can't run inside transactions. To disable transaction wrapping, add this comment before your SQL:

```sql
-- txn-mode=off
ALTER TABLE t ALTER COLUMN a TYPE VARCHAR(255);
```

## Postgres Tenant Mode

Perfect for multi-tenant PostgreSQL setups where each database has its own owner.

When enabled, Bytebase automatically switches to the database's OWNER role before executing changes, ensuring proper permissions.

## Self Approval

By default, issue creators can't approve their own changes.

To allow self-approval, enable **Allow self approval** in your project settings.
