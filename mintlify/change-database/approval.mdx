## Overview

Custom Approval enables organizations to implement multi-stage approval workflows for database changes based on their risk levels. This ensures that potentially impactful changes receive appropriate review before deployment.

### Key Features

- **Risk-based routing**: Different approval flows for different risk levels
- **Multi-stage approvals**: Chain multiple approval nodes in sequence
- **Role-based authorization**: Leverage built-in or custom roles for approvals
- **Flexible configuration**: Skip approvals for low-risk changes or require multiple approvers for critical ones

<Tip>
**Workflow Compatibility:**
- **UI Workflow**: Custom Approval integrates seamlessly with the UI-based change workflow
- **GitOps Workflow**: For GitOps, configure approvals in your VCS (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket) PR/MR process instead
</Tip>

## How Approval Works

### The Approval Process

1. **Risk Assessment**: When a database change is created, Bytebase evaluates its risk level
2. **Flow Assignment**: Based on the risk level, the appropriate approval flow is triggered
3. **Sequential Approval**: Approvers review and approve each node in order
4. **Rollout**: After all approvals, changes proceed to deployment

### Understanding Risk Levels

Bytebase categorizes database changes into risk levels based on:
- Operation type (DDL vs DML)
- Affected data volume
- Target environment
- Custom risk rules

<Info>
Learn more about configuring risk levels in [Risks](/administration/risks) to fine-tune how changes are categorized and routed for approval.

## Configuration Guide

### Step 1: Design Your Approval Flows

Navigate to **Settings > Custom Approval > Approval Flows**

#### Creating an Approval Flow

1. Click **Create** to add a new flow
2. Name your flow descriptively (e.g., "Production DDL Review")
3. Add approval nodes:
   - Each node represents one approval stage
   - Specify the required role for each node (built-in or [custom role](/administration/roles))
   - Nodes execute in the order you define

### Step 2: Map Flows to Risk Levels

Navigate to **Settings > Custom Approval > Rules**

1. For each risk level (Low, Moderate, High), select:
   - An approval flow to enforce
   - Or "Skip manual approval" for automated processing
2. Save your configuration

### Step 3: Configure Project Settings

In your project settings, consider:

- **Self-approval**: By default, users cannot approve their own changes. [Enable self-approval](/change-database/settings#self-approval) only if your process allows it
- **Rollout Policy**: Define whether approved changes deploy automatically or require manual trigger via [rollout policy](/change-database/environment-policy/rollout-policy/)
