title: Online Schema Migration for MySQL
description: This guide shows you how to use gh-ost to migrate your MySQL databases in Bytebase.

<PricingPlanBlock feature_name='ONLINE_SCHEMA_CHANGE' />

[gh-ost](https://github.com/github/gh-ost) is a triggerless online schema migration tool for MySQL. Bytebase leverages gh-ost to migrate MySQL table schemas with little downtime.

All existing online schema change tools operate similarly:

1. Create a ghost table in the likeness of your original table.
2. Migrate that table while empty, slowly and incrementally copy data from your original table to the ghost table, meanwhile propagating ongoing changes (any `INSERT`, `DELETE`, `UPDATE` applied to your table) to the ghost table.
3. Finally, they replace your original table with the ghost table at the right time.

## Requirements and limitations

- MySQL versions 5.7 or greater.
- Enable row-based logging.
- Bytebase currently only supports migrating on the primary.
- Foreign key constraints are not supported.
- Triggers are not supported.

For an exhaustive list, please refer to this [doc](https://github.com/github/gh-ost/blob/master/doc/requirements-and-limitations.md).

## How to use

### Step 1 - Create an edit schema issue

1. Click **Edit Schema**, choose the database, input SQL and click **Preview issue**.
2. Before clicking **Create**, turn on **Online migration**. You may click **Configure** to customize the parameters.

The online migration mode has two tasks:

- **Sync data**: sync your data to the ghost table.
- **Switch tables**: replace your original table with the ghost table.

3. Click **Sync data** and you'll find your SQL in the editor. After verifying that, click **Create**.

### Step 2 - Rollout the sync data task

After creating the issue, the **Sync data** task is `waiting for approval` (if custom approval flow is configured) or `waiting for rollout`. Follow the order to roll out the task.

The **Sync data** task reads rows on the original table and writes them to the ghost table, meanwhile propagating changes in the original table to the ghost table so that the ghost table can catch up with the original table.

Behind the scenes, gh-ost will create two tables:

- The changelog table: `~yourtablename_{timestamp}_ghc`
- The ghost table: `~yourtablename_{timestamp}_gho`

If anything goes wrong, manually drop these two tables: `~yourtablename_{timestamp}_gho` and `~yourtablename_{timestamp}_ghc`, then retry.

### Step 3 - Rollout the switch tables task

Depending on your table size, the **Sync data** task could take some time to process. When the difference between the ghost table and the original table is small enough, the task automatically completes.

The **Switch tables** task automatically renames `yourtablename`, `~yourtablename_{timestamp}_gho` to `~yourtablename_{timestamp}_del`, `yourtablename` respectively to switch the original table and the ghost table.

After the **Sync data** task completes, the **Switch tables** task is `waiting for approval` (if custom approval flow is configured) or `waiting for rollout`. Follow the order to roll out the task.

### Step 4 - Delete `~yourtablename_{timestamp}_del` after migration

After migration, the original table is renamed to `~yourtablename_{timestamp}_del`. Make sure there is no data loss, then manually drop the original table if you wish. You can check the table by clicking **Show Bytebase reserved tables** on the database page.

## Interact with gh-ost

Gh-ost listens on a UNIX socket file.

The UNIX socket file name is `/tmp/gh-ost.{taskID}.{databaseID}.{databaseName}.{tableName}.sock`

To find the UNIX socket file, you must acquire the database and task id.

![bb-db-db-id](/content/docs/change-database/online-schema-migration-for-mysql/bb-db-db-id.webp)

In this example, my socket file name is `/tmp/gh-ost.112.107.employeenofk.employee.sock`

### Show gh-ost status

<Note>

Replace `taskID`, `databaseID`, `databaseName` and `tableName` accordingly.

</Note>

If Bytebase is running on docker, show gh-ost status with the command below:

```text
docker exec -it bytebase /bin/sh
```

```text
echo "status" | nc local:/tmp/gh-ost.taskID.databaseID.databaseName.tableName.sock
```

Otherwise, execute the command below:

```text
echo "status" | nc -U /tmp/gh-ost.taskID.databaseID.databaseName.tableName.sock
```

### Kill gh-ost manually

<Note>

Replace `taskID`, `databaseID`, `databaseName` and `tableName` accordingly.

</Note>

Sometimes you want to kill gh-ost. Maybe it’s because gh-ost is so slow, or you find a typo in your sql statement.
To kill gh-ost, you issue "panic" to the UNIX socket file on which gh-ost listens.

If Bytebase is running on docker, execute the command below to kill gh-ost:

```text
docker exec -it bytebase /bin/sh
```

```text
echo "panic" | nc local:/tmp/gh-ost.taskID.databaseID.databaseName.tableName.sock
```

Otherwise, run the command below:

```text
echo "panic" | nc -U /tmp/gh-ost.taskID.databaseID.databaseName.tableName.sock
```

After that, you have to do the cleanup.

Remove these two files:

- `/tmp/gh-ost.taskID.databaseID.databaseName.tableName.sock`
- `/tmp/gh-ost.taskID.databaseID.databaseName.tableName.postponeFlag`

Drop these two tables:

- `~yourtablename_{timestamp}_gho`
- `~yourtablename_{timestamp}_ghc`
