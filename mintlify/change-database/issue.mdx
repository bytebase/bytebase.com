**Issue** drives the database change workflow. You can change the issue behavior under the **Issue Related** section of **Project** -> **Setting**.

## Postgres database tenant mode

By default, Bytebase executes database changes using the credentials configured in your Bytebase instance.

When you enable this setting, Bytebase automatically switches to the target PostgreSQL database's OWNER role (via `SET LOCAL ROLE`) before executing changes.

This feature is particularly valuable for multi-tenant environments where each database has its own distinct owner, ensuring changes are always executed with appropriate permissions.

## Self approval

Issue creators themselves are not allowed to approve the issue by default.

To allow self approval, check the **Allow self approval** option box under the **Issue Related** section of **Setting** in a certain project.
