title: Transaction Mode
---

Bytebase wraps all SQL statements in a transaction by default. This ensures that changes are atomic and can be rolled back if an error occurs, providing a safeguard for database integrity.

However, there are scenarios where you might want to disable transaction wrapping. For example, certain DDL (Data Definition Language) statements, such as altering table structures, may not be compatible with transactions in some databases. In such cases, you can disable transaction wrapping using the directive `-- txn-mode=off`.
```sql
-- txn-mode=off
ALTER TABLE t ALTER COLUMN a TYPE VARCHAR(255);
```
