Bytebase provides transaction management to ensure safe database changes. By default, all SQL statements are wrapped in a transaction, allowing automatic rollback if errors occur during execution.

## Enable/Disable Transactions

When creating a plan, you can control whether SQL statements are executed within a transaction:

- **Enabled (default)**: All statements run within a transaction boundary for safety
- **Disabled**: Statements execute directly without transaction wrapping

## MySQL-Specific Settings

For MySQL databases, Bytebase offers additional control over transaction isolation levels to manage concurrent access and data consistency:

### Available Isolation Levels

- **READ UNCOMMITTED**: Lowest isolation, allows dirty reads
- **READ COMMITTED**: Prevents dirty reads, allows non-repeatable reads
- **REPEATABLE READ**: Default MySQL isolation, prevents dirty and non-repeatable reads
- **SERIALIZABLE**: Highest isolation, prevents all phenomena but may impact performance

## Best Practices

- Keep transactions enabled for DDL and DML operations that modify data
- Consider disabling transactions only for:
  - Large batch operations that manage their own transaction boundaries
  - Statements that cannot run within transactions (e.g., certain administrative commands)
- Choose appropriate isolation levels based on your concurrency requirements and performance needs
