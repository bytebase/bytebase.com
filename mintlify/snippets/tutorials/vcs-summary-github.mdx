Now you have tried out GitOps workflow, which will store your database schema in GitHub and trigger the change upon committing the change to the repository via Pull Request, to bring your database change workflow to the next level of Database DevOps - [Database as Code](/blog/database-as-code).

If the built-in workflow is not suitable, you can opt to [Bytebase API](/docs/api/overview) to fully customize the workflow to integrate with your CI pipeline. [Automating Database Schema Change workflow Using GitHub Actions](/docs/tutorials/github-ci/) is an example.
