### Schema Drift

Bytebase has built-in [schema drift detection](/change-database/drift-detection/) to detect unexpected schema changes. Let's use the [SQL Editor Admin Mode](/sql-editor/admin-mode/) to simulate this.

1. Click **terminal icon** (SQL Editor) on the top right. You'll be redirected to **SQL Editor**. Click **Admin mode**. Everything you do in this mode is the same as connecting directly to the server, which is not recorded by Bytebase.

1. Select `(Prod) employee` on the left, and paste and run the following script:

   ```sql
       ALTER TABLE "public"."employee"
       ADD COLUMN "city" text NOT NULL DEFAULT '';
   ```

1. Go back to Bytebase Console, and click **Databases** > `employee` under `Prod`. Click **Sync Now**. After seeing the success message, refresh the page. You'll see the schema drift. You may configure auto scan on instance detail page to avoid manual sync.

1. Go to **Database** > **Anomalies**, and you'll see the Schema drift there too.
