    If you have **Enterprise Plan**, you can create a **Custom Role** for the service account which require fewer permissions, and assign this role instead of DBA:

        - plans.create
        - plans.get
        - plans.preview
        - releases.check
        - releases.create
        - releases.get
        - rollouts.create
        - rollouts.get
        - rollouts.list
        - sheets.create
        - sheets.get
        - taskRuns.create
        - planCheckRuns.list
        - planCheckRuns.run
