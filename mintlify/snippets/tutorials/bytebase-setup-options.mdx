  <Tab title="Cloud">
    Use [Bytebase Cloud](https://hub.bytebase.com/) for instant setup without infrastructure management. CI/CD services can connect immediately.
    
    **Best for:** Quick testing, evaluation, and small teams
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Self-Hosted">
    Run Bytebase in Docker within your infrastructure:
    
    <TerminalDockerRunVolume />
    
    **Network Access Options:**
    
    - **For testing:** Use tools such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [VS Code port forwarding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/port-forwarding) to temporarily expose your local Bytebase to cloud CI/CD services. After exposing, configure the **External URL** in Bytebase **Settings > General**.
    
    - **For production:** Use self-hosted CI/CD runners within your private network. Never expose production Bytebase to the internet.
    
    **Best for:** Organizations with security requirements or existing infrastructure
