title: Start Bytebase with ngrok
---

import TerminalDockerRunVolume from '/snippets/install/terminal-docker-run-volume.mdx';

For production, use Bytebase Cloud or self-hosted Bytebase with proper setup.

For local testing, you can expose your Bytebase instance with ngrok to test GitOps workflows — this lets cloud VCS and SSO services (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) reach your local Bytebase.

### Setup

    ![ngrok-reverse-proxy](/content/docs/get-started/start-with-ngrok/ngrok-reverse-proxy.webp)

1. Run Bytebase in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) with the following command:

   <TerminalDockerRunVolume />

1. Once Bytebase is running in Docker, you can access it at `localhost:8080`.

1. Log in to the [ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup) and complete the **Getting Started** steps to install and configure ngrok. To use a consistent domain, navigate to **Universal Gateway > Endpoints** to find your assigned domain: `<<YOURS>>.ngrok-free.app`.

1. Start ngrok with your domain by running:

   ```bash
   ngrok http --url=<<YOURS>>.ngrok-free.app 8080
   ```

   You should see output similar to this:

   ![terminal-ngrok](/content/docs/get-started/start-with-ngrok/ngrok-terminal.webp)

1. You can now access Bytebase at `https://<<YOURS>>.ngrok-free.app` for testing.

1. (Optional) For SSO testing, set the ngrok URL as **External URL** in Bytebase **Settings > General > Network**.
