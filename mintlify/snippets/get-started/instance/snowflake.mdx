To find the **Account Locator**, go to your Snowflake account, you can find it in the URL, or from the **locator field (but lower case)**.

If the account is located in the AWS US West (Oregon) region, then it would be something like `xy12345`, otherwise, the format will be `<<account_locator>>.<<cloud_region_id>>.<<cloud>>` such as `xy12345.us-east-2.aws`. See [official doc](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier#using-an-account-locator-as-an-identifier).
