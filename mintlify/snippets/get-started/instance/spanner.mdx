### Specify Google Cloud Project ID and Spanner Instance ID

![Spanner database detail page](/content/docs/get-started/instance/spanner/spanner-url.webp)

From the Spanner database detail page, you can get the project ID and the instance ID from the URL.

For example, the project ID and instance ID are `spanner-test-3717002` and `spanner-bb1` respectively for the above database.

### Create a Google Cloud Service Account as the Credential

1. Go to [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
1. Click **APIs & Services** and then **Credentials**. You might have to click **Menu** on the top left first.
1. Click **Create Credentials** and then **Service account**.
1. For **Service account name**, enter a name for the service account.
1. Click **Create and Continue**.
1. For **Select a role**, select **Cloud Spanner Database Admin** for the service account.
1. Click **Done**.
1. Click the created service account.
1. At the top, click **Keys** and then **Add Key** and then **Create new key**. Make sure the key type is set to **JSON** and click **Create**.
1. You'll get a message that the service account's private key JSON file was downloaded to your computer. Make a note of the file name and where your browser saves it. You'll need it later.

Upload the JSON file to the `Credentials` input.
