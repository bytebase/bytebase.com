For managing Oracle database, Bytebase provides two manage modes: **Manage based on database** and **Manage based on schema**.
You can choose the manage mode when adding an instance or in the instance detail page.

### Manage based on database

In this mode, Bytebase will manage the database as a whole.

- For normal Oracle instance, we treat the Oracle database as a Bytebase database.
- For CDB instance, we treat the CDB and all PDBs as Bytebase databases.
- For PDB instance, we treat the PDB as a Bytebase database.

### Manage based on schema

In this mode, Bytebase will manage the schema as a whole.

- For any Oracle database, we treat the Oracle schema as a Bytebase database.
