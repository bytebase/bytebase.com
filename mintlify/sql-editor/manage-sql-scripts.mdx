title: Manage SQL Scripts with Sheet
---

`Sheet` is the medium for you to interact inside SQL Editor. Sheet is the entity where you store,
run and share the SQL scripts with your teammates.

## Save sheet

Click **Save** on the upper right of the Editor or use the shortcut key `(âŒ˜ + S)` to save
your SQL queries for later reference. SQL Editor will also automatically record SQL queries which
have run successfully.

the **History** panel on the left.

## Configure sheet access

You can configure the sheet with one of the following access levels:

- `Private` - Only you can access this sheet
- `Project` - Both sheet OWNER and project OWNER can read/write, and project DEVELOPER can read
- `Public` - Sheet OWNER can read/write, and all others can read
