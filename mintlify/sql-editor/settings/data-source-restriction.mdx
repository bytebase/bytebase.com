title: Data Source Restriction
---

You may select data sources between the admin and [read-only connection](/get-started/instance/#read-only-connection) while running SQL queries in SQL Editor.

The **Admin Data Source Query Restrictions** could be set either by environment or project level.

![bb-data-source-project](/content/docs/sql-editor/settings/bb-data-source-project.webp)

If both are set, the higher restriction will be applied. The order of restriction level from high to low is as follows:

1. ON
   - Disallow querying data from the admin data source
   - Fallback to the admin data source if no read-only data source is available
1. Off
