To separate from admin connection, you can configure read-only connections used by SQL Editor once an instance is added. This separation can be configured at the database user/role access control level or replication instance level.

1. Create a new role with read-only access or a read-replica instance.
1. Click **Create** or **+** on **Connection info**.
1. Enter read-only connection info. If this is a read-replica instance, you need to enter its host and port information.
1. Click **Update** to finish the configuration.
1. Click **+** to add more, or click trash icon to delete.
