title: SQL Editor Limits
---

To ensure stable performance and efficient resource usage, Bytebase allows you to configure execution limits for SQL queries in the workspace.

## How to Configure

In the workspace, go to **Settings** > **General**, then scroll to the **Security** section. You can set the following limits:

### Maximum SQL Result Size

Sets the maximum size of query results returned in the SQL Editor.

- **Unit:** MB
- Helps prevent memory issues caused by large result sets.
- _Example: 100 MB_

### Maximum SQL Result Rows

Limits the number of rows returned by a single query.

- A value of `0` or below means **no row limit**.
- Helps avoid performance degradation due to excessive row counts.
- _Example: 1 row_

### Maximum Query Time

Defines the maximum time (in seconds) a SQL query is allowed to run.

- A value of `0` means **no time limit**.
- Queries exceeding this time will be automatically terminated.
- _Example: 60 seconds_
