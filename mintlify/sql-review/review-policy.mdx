<Card title="Tutorial: Codify SQL Review Policies with Bytebase API" icon="graduation-cap" href="/tutorials/api-sql-review-policy" horizontal />

In Bytebase, you can establish a SQL Review Policy for each [environment](/concepts/data-model#environment) or [project](/concepts/data-model/#project). This policy consists of a set of [SQL lint rules](/sql-review/review-rules) tailored to each database engine. Once configured, Bytebase will check SQL against those rules.

## Change Rule Level

You can choose one of `Error`, `Warning` and `Disabled`.

Both `Warning` and `Error` will block the [automatic rollout](/change-database/environment-policy/rollout-policy/#automatic-rollout) if configured.

## Attach to Resources

<Note>

**Project** level policy has higher priority than **Environment** one.

</Note>

You can attach the **SQL Review Policy** to environments or projects. Only **ONE** policy can be attached per **Environment** or **Project**.
