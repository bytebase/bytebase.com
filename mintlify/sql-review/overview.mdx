To avoid exceedingly long review time, Bytebase skips SQL Review if the statements exceed 1MB in size.

SQL Review automatically detects SQL anti-patterns and reduce manual review workload. Bytebase has designed an automatic process to reduce the work for DBAs who are required to do manual SQL review.

DBA first chooses [SQL Review rules](/docs/sql-review/review-rules) per each database engine to build a unified [Review policy](/docs/sql-review/review-policy) and then chooses environments or projects to apply it.

Later, when developers submit SQLs in the [database change workflow](/docs/change-database/change-workflow/), Bytebase will check these rules automatically before the DBAs review.
