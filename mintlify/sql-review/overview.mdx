title: SQL Review

<Note>

To avoid exceedingly long review time, Bytebase skips SQL Review if the statements exceed 1MB in size.

</Note>

SQL Review automatically detects SQL anti-patterns and reduce manual review workload. Bytebase has designed an automatic process to reduce the work for DBAs who are required to do manual SQL review.

DBA first chooses [SQL Review rules](/sql-review/review-rules) per each database engine to build a unified [Review policy](/sql-review/review-policy) and then chooses environments or projects to apply it.

Later, when developers submit SQLs in the [database change workflow](/change-database/change-workflow/), Bytebase will check these rules automatically before the DBAs review.

## UI Integration

<Card title="Tutorial: SQL Review with Bytebase GUI" icon="graduation-cap" href="/tutorials/sql-review-gui" horizontal />

SQL advisor runs automatic SQL checks when:

- Schema or data change
- Data query

### Schema or data change process

On a specific issue page, the advisor will run automatically after creation:

![sql-advisor](/content/docs/sql-review/schema-review-engine-mysql-use-innodb.webp)

It currently supports the following checks:

- [SQL Review Rules](/sql-review/review-policy)
- Database connection failure
- Syntax error
- Migration schema missing (the internal bytebase schema recording the migration history)
