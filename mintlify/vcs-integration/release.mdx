title: Release
---

A release is an immutable, deployable artifact that contains database changes. It serves as the database equivalent of a Docker image in modern CI/CD pipelines.

## Overview

In Bytebase's GitOps workflow, a release is automatically created when changes are merged to your main branch. It packages all SQL migration files into a single deployable unit that can be progressively rolled out across your database environments.

## Key Characteristics

- **Immutable** - Once created, a release cannot be modified, ensuring deployment consistency
- **Version-controlled** - Each release is tied to a specific VCS commit for full traceability
- **Environment-agnostic** - The same release can be deployed across test, staging, and production
- **Auditable** - Complete history of creation, deployment, and rollback operations
- **Idempotent** - Bytebase automatically detects and skips already applied migrations, preventing duplicate executions

## Benefits

### Consistency

The same release deployed to test is exactly what gets deployed to production - no manual SQL copying or modification.

### Idempotent Deployment

Bytebase tracks which migrations have been applied to each database. When deploying a release:

- Already applied migrations are automatically skipped
- Only new migrations are executed
- Safe to re-deploy the same release multiple times
- No risk of duplicate schema changes or data corruption

### Compliance

- Every change is reviewed before release creation
- Deployment requires appropriate approvals
- Full audit trail for regulatory requirements

### Integration

Releases integrate seamlessly with existing CI/CD tools, treating database changes with the same rigor as application deployments.
