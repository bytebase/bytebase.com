## Content Guide

The repo hosts 3 major content types:

- Blog at https://www.bytebase.com/blog
- Changelog at https://www.bytebase.com/changelog

For general writing guide, please check [this writing guide](https://github.com/bytebase/bytebase/blob/main/docs/writing-guide.md).

### General

#### Naming

All lowercase with `-` as word separator:

- `my-awesome-post.md`
- `my-awesome-image.webp`

#### Image

- Naming: choose a **readable** image name.
- Sizing: use **16:9** ratio if possible. The feature image sizing **must** be 16:9.
- Format: use **WebP** instead of PNG format to reduce image size.

#### Recording

Use animated recording judicious. Sometimes you have to use animation to showcase the feature, however, recording requires much larger size and slows page loading speed. In most cases, we should have at most 1 recording per page.

- Format: Try [converting GIF to WebP](https://ezgif.com/gif-to-webp/) to see if the size can be reduced. If not, then use GIF.

- Do **NOT** use feature image

## Code Style

**Skip this if you only change documentation**

### ESLint

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) helps find and fix code style issues and force developers to follow same rules. Current configuration is based on `eslint:recommended`, `next/core-web-vitals` and `@typescript-eslint/recommended` rules sets.

Additional commands:

```bash
pnpm run lint
```

Run it to check the current status of eslint issues across project.

```bash
pnpm run lint:fix
```

Run it to fix all possible issues.

### Prettier

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) helps to format code based on defined rules. [Difference between Prettier and ESLint](https://prettier.io/docs/en/comparison.html).

Additional commands:

```bash
pnpm run format
```

Run it to format all files across the project.

### VS Code

Following extensions required to simplify the process of keeping the same code style across the project:

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

After installation, VS Code will be use settings from the `.vscode/settings.json` file and will be fixing and formatting your code automatically on paste and save actions.

## Vercel

www.bytebase.com is hosted on Vercel. Upon successful deployment, Vercel will post a webhook event to /api/index-to-algolia to rebuild the index.

```bash
curl -X POST https://www.bytebase.com/api/index-to-algolia/
```
