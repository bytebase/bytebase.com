        The SLA times listed are the time frames in which you can expect the first response.
        Bytebase Support will make a best effort to resolve any issues to your satisfaction as
        quickly as possible. However, the SLA times are not to be considered as an expected
        time-to-resolution. The SLAs apply to the Enterprise plan and exclude beta features.
